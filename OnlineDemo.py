            'EU\'s new competition chief may be bad news for Google After waiting more than four years for Brussels to resolve his anti-trust complaint against Google while traffic to his website plunged by 80%, Michael Weber of German online mapping service Hot-Map.com held out little hope of success. Until now.He says a meeting with the new competition chief of the European Commission has left him with newfound hope that Brussels will take action at last to curb behavior by the US internet giant, which he blames for hurting his business.Danish politician Margrethe Vestager, who took over the EU competition portfolio in November, inherited an anti-trust complaint by more than a dozen companies against Google, left unresolved by her Spanish predecessor Joaquin Almunia.Almunia launched an investigation in 2010 and initially concluded that Google may have hurt competitors by favoring its own products and services in search results and blocking advertisers from moving their campaigns to rival platforms.Since then, Google has offered three settlement proposals to resolve the case. Most recently, just over a year ago, it offered to give competing products and services bigger visibility on its website, let content providers decide what material it can use for its own services and make it easier for advertisers to move their campaigns to rivals.Almunia initially accepted that deal, only to reverse his decision six months later and demand more concessions, leaving the ultimate decision to his successor.So far, Vestager has said nothing in public that would explicitly signal what course she is considering.She has also indicated that she will not rush into a decision. Asked whether enforcement regulators should emphasize quick action in cases involving fast-moving technologies, Vestager told Reuters: "I don\'t think that speed should be the priority. We should be even handed and open minded in interpretation of the facts. Of course it is better to be fast than slow but it\'s even better to be just."Nevertheless, executives from some of the companies that brought the complaint against Google say they are more optimistic now than they have been for years, and that they believe action is finally coming soon."With Almunia, there was no real dialogue. With Vestager, it is different. The questions she asked us show that she understands the complainants\' problems," said Weber.Another of the complainants, who spoke on condition of anonymity because a meeting with Vestager was confidential, said: "The first thing she said at the meeting was that she understands the harm we have suffered."The European Commission declined to comment on the case.Asked to discuss anti-trust issues, Google spokesman Al Verney declined to comment.High stakes The stakes are high for Google which faces a fine of as much as $6.6 billion if found guilty of anti-competitive behavior. Even more disruptive, it may have to modify its business practices.Google\'s dominant positions in markets like online search, advertising and smartphone operating systems have drawn regulatory scrutiny in various jurisdictions around the globe.Its longstanding position is that competition is "just a click away"  a phrase meant to indicate that users have easy access to use rival services  and that its products are popular because people find them useful.Vestager, 46, was a free-trading economy minister in Denmark who jolted Danes with deep cuts to the social welfare system, earning a reputation as a firm negotiator before coming to Brussels.She has spoken in general terms of the need to keep fast-changing industries open and contestable and said both large and small players should be able to compete on the merits of their products, comments that some of the Google complainants have interpreted as sympathetic towards their case.They also note that she met some of the complainants before seeing Google\'s executive chairman Eric Schmidt and general counsel Kent Walker last month.In one sign of movement in recent weeks, the European Commission has asked some of the Google opponents to allow regulators to declassify some of the confidential data they submitted to justify their accusations, a step that would be necessary to present the data to Google for its response.Wilko van Weert, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery and specialist in the field, said Vestager could push for a settlement that would require Google to provide more information about its search ranking formula."Coming from a Scandinavian culture where transparency is very important, I would not be surprised if she pushes for maximum transparency in the way Google organizes and manages its search results," he said.Any ruling by Vestager might have to be able to survive a potential court challenge from Google, which could be tougher to withstand because of Almunia\'s previous reversals.Vestager may initially want to play hard ball, but that does not mean she will close the door to a settlement, said Mario Mariniello, a former economist at the Commission\'s competition unit and now an expert at think tank Bruegel."If at a certain point in the process effective remedies addressing her objections would be offered by Google, I guess it would be hard for her to say no," he said.',

            ' First boron buckyballs roll out of the lab Score one for boron. For the first time, a version of the famous football-shaped buckyball has been created from boron.Discovered in 1985, buckyballs are made from 60 carbon atoms linked together to form hollow spheres. The molecular cages are very stable and can withstand high temperatures and pressures, so researchers have suggested they might store hydrogen at high densities, perhaps making it a viable fuel source. At normal pressures, too much of the lightweight gas can escape from ordinary canisters, and compressing it requires bulky storage tanks.Boron sits next to carbon in the periodic table, so a boron ball may also display useful properties. But it wasn\'t clear whether boron could form such structures.Meet borospherene Now Lai-Sheng Wang at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and his colleagues have made a cage-like molecule with 40 boron atoms by vaporising a chunk of boron with a laser then freezing it with helium, creating boron clusters. The team analysed the energy spectra of these clusters and compared them with computer models of 10,000 possible arrangements of boron atoms. The matching configuration revealed they had created the boron ball.Unlike carbon buckyballs, in which the faces are made of hexagons and pentagons, the boron buckyball is made from triangles, hexagons and heptagons. As a result, it is less spherical but still an enclosed structure. Wang has dubbed the molecule "borospherene". The team is now hunting for a boron analogue of graphene  a strong sheet of carbon just one atom thick that is often touted as a "wonder" material because of its unique electrical properties.Mark Fox at Durham University, UK likes the name  and is excited at the prospect of finding a boron version of graphene. Buckyballs led to the discovery of graphene, he says, and history may repeat itself with boron. ',

            ' Einstein puts a ring on distant galaxy , meet Einstein. The physicist\'s theory of general relativity, which celebrates its centenary this year, is responsible for putting a giant cosmic ring on a galaxy hidden at the centre of this image.The ring is actually an illusion created by the alignment of two distant galaxies as seen from Earth. Albert Einstein\'s theory predicts that the gravitational effects of the nearer galaxy bends the light of the more distant one around it, a process called gravitational lensing. This poignant moment was captured by the ALMA radio telescope array in Chile last October.The distant galaxy, in glowing orange, is known as SDP.81 and is nearly 12 billion light years away. The closer galaxy, not visible in this image, is only 4 billion light years away and has the less snappy name SDSS J090311.57+003906.5.Gravitational lensing provides astronomers with a way of studying distant galaxies in greater detail than would otherwise be possible. ALMA picks up light emitted by glowing dust in SDP.81 and also sees signs of carbon monoxide and water molecules in the ring, helping astronomers determine its structure and internal motion. ',

            'Large Hadron Collider beam is back in action The beam is back. At 10.41 am local time on 5 April, a pulse of protons flew through the enormous circular track of the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, Switzerland for the first time in two years  followed at 12.27 pm by a beam circulating in the opposite direction.This is the first of several milestones in the LHC\'s return to life after two years of extensive upgrades. The reboot will culminate in smashing protons together with a combined energy of 13 teraelectronvolts  almost double the energy of the first run.But first, it needs a warm-up. Today\'s beams circulated at a test energy of 450 GeV, just under 10 per cent of their ultimate energy."The return of beams to the LHC rewards a lot of intense, hard work from many teams of people," said Paul Collier, CERN\'s head of beams, in a statement. "It\'s very satisfying for our operators to be back in the driver\'s seat, with what\'s effectively a new accelerator to bring on-stream, carefully, step by step."Unfinished businessThe reboot was delayed slightly when a short-circuit was discovered in one of the LHC\'s magnets a few weeks ago. A needle-thin string of metal, probably solder, was connecting bits of circuit that should have been kept separate. After studying several ways to fix the problem, the team decided to melt the offending metal by sending a current of 400 amps through it. The effect was similar to blowing a fuse.The charred bits of metal are still in the machine, Collier says, but out of harm\'s way.The collider operators will now check all systems before increasing the beam\'s energy. They expect the first collisions between two bunches of protons to happen in June, Collier says.Physicists hope that the revamped LHC will help find some new physics beyond the standard model, the existing paradigm of particles and forces. The Higgs boson, discovered at the LHC in 2012, was the last missing piece of the standard model, but the theory does not include a host of things physicists know exist, such as dark matter and gravity."We have unfinished business with understanding the universe," says Tara Shears of the University of Liverpool, who works on the LHCb experiment. "We want to chase the hints we\'ve seen in previous measurements, whose behaviour didn\'t quite match our expectations, in case these hints turn into discoveries." ',

            ' Dark energy could signal collapse of the universe TALK about a cure that\'s worse than the disease. A proposed quantum field can account for the universe\'s ever-quickening expansion, but it would also trigger the universe\'s death in a catastrophic collapse.In 1998, astronomers discovered that the universe has been ballooning at ever-faster rates for the past few billion years. They dubbed the mysterious entity responsible "dark energy" and have been striving to identify it ever sinceMovie Camera.The simplest explanation is that particles briefly bubbling into and out of existence imbue every cupful of space with the energy needed to accelerate the universe\'s growth. But this quantum stew, known as vacuum energy, is no panacea.Energy, like matter, causes space to curve, according to Einstein\'s general theory of relativity. Calculations suggest that this vacuum energy is so strong that it would make the universe curve in on itself until it spans less than the distance from Earth to the moon  and clearly it\'s bigger.To get around this discrepancy, Nemanja Kaloper of the University of California, Davis, and Antonio Padilla of the University of Nottingham in the UK attempted to cancel out the curvature caused by the quantum instabilities by modifying the equations of general relativity on the largest scale possible: the whole of space-time.Last year, they found a way to do this that cancels out nearly all of the vacuum energy, leaving just enough to explain the acceleration we observe (Physical Review Letters, doi.org/273). But their method requires space-time to be finite, which implies that cosmic expansion must eventually stop and reverse, causing time to end when the universe collapses. "The universe returns back to where it banged from," says Kaloper.Now the researchers have proposed a trigger for that collapse: a new quantum field that permeates the universe. The field\'s energy would drop slowly over time, eventually becoming negative and setting off the cosmos\'s contraction. Before the contraction begins, however, the field would cause the universe\'s initial expansion to accelerate, just as it is doing now. "It\'s as if the dark energy is the harbinger of doom," says Padilla (Physical Review Letters, doi.org/274)."It\'s an interesting approach, but it\'s still incomplete," says Asimina Arvanitaki of the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo, Canada. "What is the underlying theory that tells you that this is how you should write down your equations?" The researchers are now working on a generalisation of their proposal that should help address these concerns, says Kaloper. They are also calculating when the universe\'s contraction may begin, though they suspect it wouldn\'t start for another few tens of billions of years, says Padilla."We\'re pretty safe," says Arvanitaki. "I\'m not going to lose any sleep over it." ',

            'Why Obama\'s cyber sanctions won\'t deter digital crime Cybercrooks beware: Obama is coming for you. The US president declared a national state of emergency over cybercrime at the start of April, promising to use the "authorities of my office" to track down and punish malicious hackers that threaten the country. Unfortunately, it seems the plan may be doomed to fail.The order is meant to give the government power to punish people or organisations who attack US infrastructure over the internet. The perennial bogeyman of foreign hackers that steal American intellectual property are right in the crosshairs.In the Executive Order that accompanied the declaration of emergency, Obama gave the US Secretary of the Treasury the authority to "impose sanctions on individuals or entities that engage in malicious cyber-enabled activities".Any person or group that helps a cybercriminal, even if just providing "technological support", can now have all their US assets frozen on a whim of a cabinet member.But there\'s a glaring problem with the plan: unless the individuals or entities Obama plans to catch are incompetent, it will be practically impossible to pin an online attack on them, says cybersecurity analyst Jeffrey Carr.Cyber carrot and stick Forensic scientists can trace the computers that incoming malicious connections came from, but they will still have no idea who controlled the computer.Any clever attacker will hide their tracks, and it would take an exceptionally stupid one to launch an attack from a computer in their own basement, he says."Going after the attackers is a failed policy," says Carr. "It will never work. You have to strengthen your defences. You have to worry about keeping your data protected."Carr says the focus should be on creating incentives for companies to more safely store the data they hold, both their own and their customers\'."We have to focus on providing a carrot and a stick for US companies to better protect their valuable intellectual property," he says. "You need incentives for companies to spend the money on encryption at rest and in transit, and you need penalties for companies that don\'t."Beyond being ineffective, Obama\'s order risks doing real harm by legitimising US government action against any online activity with which it disagrees."I think something like this could be abused," says Carr. "If you were called out as a target and your assets were frozen, you have to fight that in court against the US government. Who has the ability to do that?" ',

            ' Drones cleared to check power lines after outages AFTER the storm comes the drone. Electricity firm Commonwealth Edison, based in Illinois, has announced plans to start sending drones to inspect power lines.The utility is the first in the US to receive permission from the Federal Aviation Authority to use drones for inspecting equipment. Since September, the FAA has selectively granted permission to a handful of companies interested in flying drones, like television and construction firms.Commonwealth Edison has been considering drones since 2011, after a particularly bad spate of storms knocked out service for 900,000 customers. Before repair crews could be sent out, employees first had to drive or even walk the length of the power lines several times, noting the particulars of each problem: where it occurred, what type of wire was used, how many poles or transformers were affected. That meant a long wait for many before power was restored."Many of our lines are not along roadways and are not readily accessible," says chief operating officer Terry Donnelly.Starting in a few months, the firm plans to fly drones fitted with cameras along lines in rural areas. They will record pictures and video of any damage. An infrared camera may also be added, to pinpoint hot spots on the line where failures are more likely.The company will need to follow rules laid out for other drone operators, including keeping the craft away from airports and within the pilot\'s line of sight. It also says it will alert local officials ahead of time to expect the drones.Brian Argrow, an aerospace engineer at the University of Colorado in Boulder, says utilities have been interested in drones for some time. "I think it\'s a long time coming. There\'s a risk reduction in using unmanned aerial systems to do the jobs rather than having humans and helicopters flying close to the power lines," he says.Drones with laser scanners, built by Finnish start-up Sharper Shape offer yet more possibilities. Companies could use them to find the best path through a forest for a new power line. The software creates a detailed model of the ground below that even includes individual trees and an estimate of when they might topple. And San Diego Gas and Electric (SDGE), a public utility in California, started experimenting with drones last year. Many of its power lines can only be accessed by helicopter, an expensive option. It hopes to use drones both for routine inspections and in the event of emergencies, like brush fires."We\'re always inspecting our system," says Hanan Eisenman, a spokesman for SDGE. "This tech would allow us to do it a lot quicker and a lot more efficiently."Covered from the air Insurance adjusters want to get airborne. Last week, US insurance giant State Farm received permission from the FAA to start drone trials. USAA in San Antonio, California, has also filed requests.The companies say drones will speed up claims processing by allowing them to quickly inspect damaged roofs after a major storm, for example.Drones are "one more innovative tool to help State Farm customers recover from the unexpected as quickly and efficiently as possible", said Wensley Herbert, operations vice president of State Farm, in a statement.',

In October 2012 Malala was shot as she boarded a school bus in the Swat Valley, Pakistan. She had risen to prominence after appearing in a BBC documentary about life under the Pakistani Taliban who controlled the area, and were stifling women\'s rights and education.After emergency medical treatment in the UK, she became a worldwide sensation, speaking in front of the UN and elsewhere about the right to education. She was co-awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts.The asteroid is described as being "printer toner" black, and whilst Malala may never get to see it, it\'s rather nice to know it\'s up there.

            ' Infosys Labs to be modelled on Xerox PARC and Bell Labs: CEO Infosys is modelling its research and development arm, Infosys Labs, on the lines of the legendary labs such as those of Xerox PARC and Bell Labs as part of a strategy that comes weeks after the organizational reshuffle that resulted in the wing being realigned to the company\'s service lines.The move comes under the directive of CEO Vishal Sikka, who started his career at Xerox PARC before founding his own start-up iBrain that was acquired by PatternRX Inc, two people familiar with the strategy said. "What Sikka wants to do is to create an A-team of innovators that can work on some of these next-gen technologies  akin to how Silicon Valley firms have built R&D labs," one of the persons said."Even if you look at companies like HP and SAP, they also have a strong R&D model that is worth replicating at Infosys which has traditionally kept Labs isolated in one corner of the company." Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre (PARC) is widely regarded as one of the world\'s foremost R&D centres for its historic contributions to the world of technology that include innovations such as the personal computer and laser printing, among others.A few weeks ago, Infosys took a step in this direction when it conducted an organizational reshuffle that resulted in Infosys Labs ceasing to exist as an independent cost centre and being more closely aligned and embedded with the company\'s verticals.With effect from April 1, division leaders at Infosys Labs have different roles and are reporting to managers including Ravi Kumar S.Infosys\' focus on R&D mirrors the strategy adopted by global rivals which have testing centres to help them keep pace with changing trends in technology."We are now focusing more on automation and in future our mission learning, artificial intelligence... those again will be driven by Infosys Labs," COO UB Pravin Rao had said in an interview with ET last November. "The engineering will be done by Infosys Labs and deployment by the business units." New services Besides his plans for Labs, Sikka is exploring newer areas of opportunity for Infosys, including the possibility of creating next-gen tech services to cater to areas such as 3D printing, home and office automation and around applications that are similar to ones created by home automation firm Nest Labs, which was acquired by Google last year, the people cited earlier said.Sikka has already started incubating new ideas within Infosys that he believes may bring the company fresh incremental revenue of $1 billion over the next few years, ET reported on Tuesday.To be sure, it is still too early to say whether Sikka\'s strategy to make big bets in newer, relatively nascent areas of technology will result in a big pay-off for Infosys in the future. But his focus on newer areas reflects a change in attitude of a typical IT services firm whose core business is traditional outsourcing."Infosys needs to start transforming everything  and starting with some of the portfolio-management capabilities. You need a VC-like kind of mentality internally to say \'we\'re gonna invest in that particular area or acquire a start-up in that area, etc\'...you need to move fast," said Frederic Giron, vice president and research director at Forrester Research."It\'s better to make some of these bets now, get a small part of the pie than get nothing at all."

            'Microsoft starts drive to hire people with autism  US technology giant Microsoft has launched a pilot program to hire autistic workers at its headquarters in Washington state."People with autism bring strengths that we need at Microsoft," Mary Ellen Smith, a corporate vice president wrote in a company blog last week."Each individual is different, some have amazing ability to retain information, think at a level of detail and depth or excel in math or code. It\'s a talent pool that we want to continue to bring to Microsoft!" Smith, who has a son with autism who is now 19, said the program builds on longstanding efforts at Microsoft to enlist people with disabilities.Microsoft is working on the initiative with Specialisterne, a venture started by the Specialist People Foundation in Denmark. The organization\'s philosophy is to tap traits that autistic people have that can be useful to companies, for instance in software testing, programming and data entry,"The traits that usually exclude people with autism from the labor market are the very traits that make them valuable employees a Specialisterne, such as attention to detail, zero tolerance for errors and a persistence to get the job done," according to the group\'s website."We don\'t see them as people with an autism diagnosis; rather, we see them as true specialists." Specialisterne previously assisted German technology company SAP on a venture hire workers with autism. ',

            ' Review: New Apple MacBooks From the moment I took it out of the box, Apple\'s new MacBook looked and felt like an iPad.The laptop is Apple\'s lightest and thinnest yet and borrows many of the iPad\'s designs, including the lack of a fan. The result is a 2-pound (0.92 kilogram) laptop that feels almost non-existent on my lap. Yet it packs in a lot of power, including a high-resolution display and a sturdier keyboard.The new MacBook goes on sale starting at $1,299 in silver, gold or gray (the same choices as the iPad). Its box even resembles the iPad\'s.New keyboard To make the MacBook as thin as it is  a half-inch (13.1 millimeters) at the thickest point  Apple had to redesign the keyboard. Traditional keys need to be tall to properly strike the mechanism that records the keystroke. Otherwise, you\'d need to strike at the center, which many people don\'t do. With the redesign, you can strike shorter keys from the edge. Those shorter keys help keep the laptop thin.The new keyboard takes getting used to, even after a week of testing. I feel as though I need to press more firmly. But taller, old-style keys on some keyboards have started to feel flimsy by comparison, as though about to come off their springs. The new keyboard does get more comfortable over time  just don\'t expect to write a novel on Day One.Although it\'s small, the new MacBook retains a full-size keyboard. In fact, that\'s why the screen is 12 inches  it matches how much space the keyboard needs. (The screen, incidentally, is stunning  compared with MacBook Air\'s lower-resolution screen. The fish in "Finding Nemo" look colorful and sharp.) New touchpad Also contributing to thinness is a new touchpad that Apple calls Force Touch. On earlier MacBooks, the touchpad acts like a springboard. When you press it, you\'re physically moving it to activate the sensor. You also have to press harder toward the back, near the springboard\'s hinge, than you do in front. In the new MacBook, sensors are embedded, so you can get the same response anywhere.There\'s also a second sensor now to record the amount of pressure you\'re applying. A click followed by a firm press activates a number of features. Press on a document icon, and a preview pops out. Press on an address in an email, and a map opens up. On some video apps, the pressure determines how quickly you forward or rewind. These gestures primarily work with Apple apps for now, but other app developers can incorporate the functionality.The MacBook does all this magically without the touchpad actually moving. Apple added a haptic engine to replicate the feeling of clicking and pressing. It isn\'t needed technologically, but will help keep things familiar for users.Apple also updated its high-resolution, 13-inch version of the MacBook Pro with this new touchpad. I imagine future models getting it, too.Minimalism Most of the expansion ports have disappeared. In its place is a single charging port that\'s also used for accessories and video output. It uses a new standard called USB-C.The problem is most gadgets still use older USB ports, so you\'ll need a $19 adapter for a single device. It\'s likely outside parties will soon make adapters to connect multiple USB devices simultaneously, but if you use USB regularly, you might consider getting an Air or Pro model instead.A $79 adapter gives you video output, with a USB port thrown in. You also might need a $19 extender for the power cord, as the box no longer comes with it. I find the included cord too short. Cord extenders from older MacBooks will work, too.Speaking of power, I got eight to 11 hours of battery life on a single charge, which is impressive given that the high-resolution screen requires more power than regular screens. Apple saved energy by having individual pixels on the screen let through more light. It also squeezed in more battery by shrinking the circuit board and using odd shapes to fit into all remaining space. The battery life isn\'t as good as what you get on a 13-inch Air, but it should be adequate for most days.  ',

            'Motorola, Lenovo to remain separate; Moto Maker coming to India China\'s Lenovo will continue to sell both Lenovo and Motorola brands in India as it starts to identify markets where only one brand will exist, a senior executive said. "Depending on the market, we are identifying which brand is more suitable for which market. However, in a market like India where we\'ve had very good success for Lenovo and Motorola, we believe we will be able to sustain both," Colin Giles, head of worldwide sales at Motorola Mobility, told ET in an interview. India and China will most likely be the only two markets where Lenovo will sell both Lenovo and Motorola branded smartphones. North American countries including the US will get only the Motorola brand while some of the Asian countries will get only Lenovo branded smartphones, Giles said.Since Lenovo\'s acquisition of Motorola Mobility from Google in October, Giles said the company has already integrated the manufacturing and supply chain operations of the two companies and is now trying to combine many back-end operations as well. However, he said Motorola will continue to remain a separate entity and Motorola and Lenovo stores will not carry each other\'s products."We\'ve got very strong presence with Motorola in North America and Latin America and we have a very strong presence in Asia because of Lenovo. When we bring the two of them together, we get a global footprint and have the ability to scale globally.Scale will be critical for any company who wants to grow in this industry," Giles said. Giles also said that India remains the company\'s top priority and unlike in the past, all product launches will either happen first in India or along with the worldwide launch."We\'re really excited to see the success in the Indian market with three million handsets sold last year. We now want to be a part of the story to connect the next billion consumers in India," Giles said.While currently Motorola sells smartphones in India only through Flipkart, Giles said customers will soon be able to experience the devices at Motorola\'s company-owned experience-cum-service centers where customers can also order the devices through Flipkart.He said apart while the company is planning to launch a slew of 4G handsets in India, it\'ll also offer a lot of customization options that can allow personalization of devices with the launch of Moto Maker that will allow customers to choose front and back panel colors and also add personalized messages on their smartphones and watches before buying.For Motorola\'s smartwatch, Moto360, he said while only two options are available in India at the moment, many more will follow.

            'The Worst Bugs in Android 5.0 Lollipop and How to Fix Them Android 5.0 Lollipop is now upon us, and while you might be rejoicing at all the new features you can take advantage of, you might also be cursing at the state that the new OS has left your device in. We\'ve rounded up the most common Lollipop issues so far, together with the fixes you can try to get your gadgets working smoothly again.Wi-Fi issues As surely as night follows day, an operating system upgrade is going to lead to Wi-Fi issues for a number of people. Lollipop is no exception. Some users have been reporting dropped internet connections, while others can\'t get online at all. Older devices like the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 10 seem to be having the most problems. In some cases, these are known bugs inside Lollipop, and you\'re going to have to wait for Google\'s engineers to get around to pushing out a software update, but there are some tricks you can try in the meantime.In terms of suggested fixes, getting your phone or tablet to forget the network (long-press on the Wi-Fi network list) then reconnecting seems to work for a select few. The old faithful factory reset has done the trick for some, but this is a bit of a pain to work through. You might also want to uninstall some of the older apps on your device, at least temporarily: A number of users have reported Wi-Fi issues disappearing once particular third-party apps were updated with Lollipop compatibility. If you\'re running an older app that hasn\'t been updated in a while, it could be causing interference.Rebooting devices and the home router is another troubleshooting fix you might want to try, but you\'ve done that already, haven\'t you? We\'ve seen other reports that changing the Wi-Fi channel can improve performance: It\'s under the Advanced option on the Wi-Fi screen menu, or you can adjust the channel settings from your router.Battery issues Battery issues are rumored to have held up the roll-out of Lollipop and it looks like Google wasn\'t able to squash all of the bugs before the new operating system saw the light of day. Battery problems appear to be even more common than Wi-Fi ones based on the forum and social media posts we\'ve seen, though once you have got everything working correctly Android 5.0 should in theory give your device better battery life.Our familiar friend the factory reset has been known to help out some users and again there\'s the problem of older apps that haven\'t been updated since Lollipop appeared on the scene. One of these apps might be clashing with Lollipop\'s new code and causing the battery to drain unnecessarily, so you might want to try removing a few apps that haven\'t been recently updated. Remember you can see which apps are using up your device\'s juice from the Battery page in Settings.If you have enough time on your hands, you can try and work out what\'s wrong with a trial and error approach. Switch settings like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on and off, uninstall specific apps, and see what changes. But it\'s not an ideal way of spending your leisure hours. Google did push out an update to fix one battery life issue earlier this month, so make sure your version is right up to date. If you\'re still struggling with problems then all you can do is report what\'s happening and sit tight for a fix.Lagging and crashing If your phone or tablet is sluggish or crashing at random times then there are a number of possible causes and solutions. At the risk of sounding repetitive it\'s worth mentioning a factory reset again, to clear the cobwebs away and enable your device to start afresh from scratch. A simple power down and power up can also do wonders, though we\'re guessing that you\'ve already tried that if you\'ve made your way to this article.If one app seems to be at the root of the issue then the obvious next step is to uninstall it or check for an update. Head to the developer\'s support site to see if any bugs have been reported by users or the development team. As with any operating system update, it may be that certain apps are having problems adjusting to a new Lollipop-powered way of life, and bringing the whole system down with them.We\'ve seen reports that switching off some of the bells and whistles that come with Android-Google Now, OK Google support, live wallpapers, and so on-can improve the situation, and this will at least enable you to use your phone or tablet while you wait for an update. If your device is completely unusable then going back to KitKat for a while is a potential option.Video playback One of the more specific problems to crop up in forums is a video playback issue with the Wi-Fi version of the 2013 Nexus 7. Users are reporting that Lollipop loses its bearings and is unable to find the video player software when they want to watch a clip. Not really an ideal situation for a modern-day tablet. Clearing the cache of one of the affected apps (such as YouTube) has helped some people restore functionality, and you can do this from the Apps page in Settings.Other users have found success by enabling or disabling the NuPlayer from the Developer options page (this seems to be a new, experimental playback layer introduced with Lollipop). Head to About phone from the Settings app and tap the build number seven times to activate the developer options screen, and you can then try playing around with NuPlayer. If it\'s enabled then disable it and vice versa, resetting your device each time. It\'s not a troubleshooting technique to fill you with much confidence but it\'s the best that we have so far.Other than that you can fall back on the factory reset option which will wipe all temporary data from your device and may be enough to restore video playback functionality. The problem has been reported so widely that we\'d assume Google must be working on a fix, so you might just have to go elsewhere for your video playing needs until then.Those are the highlights (or lowlights) that we\'ve managed to pick from from a trawl through support forums and social media, but there are other issues out there. If you\'re still having difficulties then your best options are a detailed web search to try and find fellow sufferers (and potential fixes) or trying to send some feedback Google\'s way (just don\'t expect a speedy response). Finally, hat tips to PC Advisor, Google Groups, Android Headlines, Android Police and AndroidPit for some of the bug reports and fixes covered in this article.  ',

            'Smart Villages: Lending A Rural Flavour To Modi\'s Growth Agenda After unveiling his ambitious \'100 Smart Cities\' and \'Digital India\' plans, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month launched another audacious scheme Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (Parliamentarian\'s Model Village Scheme; this is also known as SAGY). This is his strategic move to prepare rural India for the digital age and ensure that benefits of the government\'s growth endeavours are effectively percolated to communities residing on the fringes of the mainstream society.In a nutshell, the scheme aims at creating 2,500 smart villages by 2019 Each MP should ensure that one village is turning into a model village by 2016, followed by two more villages by 2019. After 2019, each MP must develop five model villages during their tenure in their constituencies till 2024. Modi also wants MLAs to join the programme, which will add 7,000 more villages to the \'smart club\'.The initiative aims at holistic development where model villages are connected to the Internet (all government or administrative documents will be made available in digital form; thus villagers don\'t need to travel to other cities to submitting applications to or getting certificates from government bodies) and where all households have access to clean water, sanitation and low-carbon energy. Model villages will be provided basic amenities that are often only available in urban areas, and a social security system. The scheme also has an inherent rider to prevent MPs from misusing it the selected villages should neither be MPs\' own villages, nor belonging to in-laws or other relatives.These select villages are expected to reach a certain level of proficiency in terms of development that will help prevent migration of villagers to cities and farmers\' suicide; besides offering jobs to youth at local level. A litany of socially-oriented programmes can be incorporated and implemented under the scheme. It includes developing biogas plant that could make a village self-reliant for fuel requirements; implementing drip irrigation to meet water requirements for crops and providing nutritional food for pregnant women to prevent mortality (maternal or infant). SAGY comes close on the heels of the plan to develop 100 smart cities which was announced by Modi earlier. Supported by a budget allocation of Rs 7,060 crore, the plan has already elicited euphoric response from the IT sector and according to market research firm IDC, at least Rs 2,000 crore will flow into the IT sector on the back of the \'smart cities\' initiative.The smart cities may take inspiration from similar initiatives in developed countries and are likely to be modeled after local projects such as Lavasa smart city, built by HCC near Pune; Electronics City in Bangalore where US-based Cisco Systems is involved in city developmental operations; and Dholera in Gujarat all of which are under different stages of construction and completion. The government has already signed a pact with Japanese government, which will help turn Varanasi into a smart city.The smart village initiative is also an extension of Modi\'s \'digital India\' plan, which aims to promote digital inclusion with broadband connectivity down to the village level, enabling improved access to services through IT-enabled platforms. The initiative, which is worth Rs 1.13-lakh crore, will not just provide last mile internet connectivity, but also offer better access to government services and enhance development of IT skills among local people, especially youth.For Modi, who is criticised as pro-business and less-socially oriented, the \'smart village\' initiative is an opportunity to show that the development model that he envisages is not exclusive of people in the remote villages of the country.

            'Cloud specialists: IBM, Oracle looking for you As Indian corporates and governments embrace cloud in a bigger way, technology firms operating in India are looking to build armies of cloud sales professionals to tap into the demand.From large firms like IBM and Oracle to more specialized players like Red Hat, companies are looking for cloud specialists in the country, currently a very small group of people, creating an arms race for talent.US-technology giant Oracle has thrown down the gauntlet in India, with its plan to hire 300 people to create a specialized cloud sales force. The move comes as Oracle is gunning for the top spot in the cloud computing space."We want to be the No. 1 player in the cloud computing space. So you will see us accelerate our investment and hiring 300 sales people is part of that strategy to sell our range of cloud offerings in the country," Shailender Kumar, VP and regional managing director for Oracle India, said.Companies across the board are hiring, according to recruitment firms, creating a demand-supply mismatch and, even a price war, for the right talent, even though sales forces are far smaller than the teams that implement the cloud product.ET counted at least 30 job openings in cloud sales for people with 5-7 years experience on sites such as LinkedIn and Naukri.com. The job openings ranged from companies such as HP, IBM and Google to smaller IT firms such as Sonata Software. The count excludes job openings from Oracle."There is a huge demand for such professionals because companies like HP, Microsoft, IBM are aggressively hiring to expand into cloud. Because demand exceeds supply, there is a premium being paid. And getting the supply is a mix of poaching and training," Shiv Agrawal, founder of HeadHonchos. com and Managing Director of ABC Consultants, told ET.Agrawal said that a cloud professional with 7-10 years experience could earn between Rs 10-17 lakhs, with packages rising far higher for those with more experience. Rising demand cannot be filled through just poaching from other companies and will have to be tackled through training, according to industry experts."We believe that the rising demand for cloud sales professionals should be fulfilled by re-skilling the current workforce. Companies need to invest in training employees about a range of technologies as new projects demand a combination of all the technologies that cut across all the layers of a company," Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research, said.Training firms, which are already seeing a boost from companies looking to skill employees in cloud technologies, are also training the people now needed to sell those technologies in the market."Companies want sales people who can cater to cloud technologies and the function of many traditional marketing departments has changed to include a huge emphasis on cloud marketing. Most companies are utilizing in-house clouds. Organizations are therefore searching for people who can understand their business model and the vision of the owned cloud," Rohit Aggarwal, CEO and founder, Koenig Solutions Ltd, said.He added that the idea was to get a steady stream of people  trained both in the cloud and selling those services  into the market.

            'How to choose better gadgets This is the only way we can make you stick to the pledge that you will no longer buy gadgets in blissful ignorance! Have you ever thought why one power bank is costlier than another? Why hard disks are passe (almost)? Why you can still trust a cheating partner, but not a pirated anti-virus? How the dude who installed the `free wi-fi router\' at your place made a fool out of you? How anti-radiation chips undo the harm done by the heap of devices around you? If you don\'t know the answers to the above, leave everything else that you are doing right now and read this buyer\'s guide.Power Bank Mobile makers have over committed and under-delivered on battery back-up, which is why power banks have become the new fad.Genius buys it like: I don\'t subscribe to the `I\'ll buy anything that\'s cheap and Chinese\' school of thought because I want more than just the basics. My power bank should charge multiple devices simultaneously, not waste energy while charging the plugged-in device, and quickly charge itself and the devices. Then, it should automatically turn itself off when idle, should be certified for safety by safety certifications like EEE, 6 Way Circuit Protection or any other popular safety standard agency.Techxpert: Sudip De, vice-president, Adata, says, "Unlike the power bank, your mobile device is not cheap, so, if you buy a faulty product, it will damage your device." Anti-Virus Software If you ever meet someone who has purchased an anti-virus and not downloaded a pirated version of it, most likely, you are hallucinating because such people don\'t exist, and this, when anti-virus is one of the most crucial computer tools.Genius buys it like: Does my system have the RAM and processor required to run the anti-virus? Is the software itself compatible with my system? Will I be able to erase the data if the system gets stolen and click pictures of the thief when he uses my system? Does it have bootable rescue? Will the anti-virus be able to defend itself when a virus tries to disable it? If it does all of this, I will buy it.Techxpert: Pankaj Jain, director, Eset India, says, "Sadly, security comes last for an anti-virus purchaser; price is first. The biggest loss of a pirated anti-virus user is that they don\'t get the support from the developer, so if one fine day, the system crashes, the user will have no one to go to for help." An anti-virus should be anti-virus, anti-malware, antiTrojan, antirootkit, antiphishing, give email and instant messaging protection, be certified by independent testing agencies and labs, be fast, scan cloud and have 24x7 support mechanism.Mobile-scan app With growing internet activity on smartphones, a mobile scan app will soon be a must.Genius buys it like: My scan app should not consume too much battery, it should provide add-on features like tracking over and above basic scanning, blocking inappropriate websites and prohibiting downloads from non-Apple and non-Android app-stores, Most importantly, it should let me completely wipe out the data on the phone in case of theft.Techxpert: Govind Rammurthy, MD & CEO, eScan, says, "The app should warn any transmissions of contact lists and should have the ability to block the same, detect transactions that use mobile-wallets andor other forms of mobile-money and store records, transaction details on the cloud." Routers Don\'t just blame your mobile operator for the snailpaced internet; your `free\' router might be at fault.Genius buys it like: I will buy a router that is capable of handling high-speed, that lets me create small networks with limited use for guests, has parental control, is low in radiation and lets me manage media and connects multiple devices.Techxpert: Subhodeep Bhattacharya, regional director, India & SAARC, Netgear, says, "A router is the hub of the digital ecosys tem, and if it\'s built around an ignorantly purchased router, all the thrill that you expect from your high-end gadgets will come to a naught." SSDs These compact, superfast, durable and energy-efficient data storage solutions will change the way you store data.Genius buys it like: I\'ll buy an SSD as it\'s smaller, sturdier and faster than hard disks. It should preferably fit in the camera too, and have shockproof capabilities for accidental drops.Techxpert: M A Mannan, country manager  India, Corsair Memory, says, "No SSD is a poor performer but one with a 40,000 IOPS or more is better." Radiation protection chip With wireless gadgets starting to rule our lives, an anti-radiation chip, which protects you from electromagnetic radiation emitted by phones and other personal electronic devices, is a must-have.Genius buys it like: The chip has to be tested and approved for its capabilities at warding off the side-effects of benefits, by a medical institution in India.Techxpert: Pranav Poddar, MD, Synergy Environics, says, "A phone should not be used for more than six minutes in an hour and be kept at least 15-25 mm away from the body at all times. Since this is not possible, you need something, like an anti-radiation chip, that will let you use devices for extended time."  ',

            'We\'ve discovered another project in Google\'s top secret research lab  and it could change the future Google\'s top secret Google X research lab is working on a handful of projects to build better batteries for mobile devices, reports the Wall Street Journal.It\'s not just about making sure our cell phones last a little longer, though that\'s a nice side-effect too. Really, what\'s going on is that the new wave of wearable devices, flying drones, electric cars, and what-have-you are going to have higher and more specific power needs than what you get with our current lithium-ion (like in phones) and alkaline batteries (like in Wii controllers).It\'s the same reason Tesla and IBM have their own battery research efforts, too.So take for example solid-state, thin-film batteries, which offer better battery life while still being thinner and lighter than our existing batteries. They\'re currently expensive and hard to make a lot of them, but they\'d be perfect in the next generation of smartphones.But as the report notes, they\'re also perfect for Google Glass, since the better battery life helps with stuff like video, which can sap a lot of power.And perhaps more importantly, these solid, thin batteries are ideal for powering cutting-edge computing like Google\'s glucose-monitoring contact lens, since there isn\'t horrible flammable acidic juice at the core as there are with today\'s batteries.In the future, computers aren\'t just going to be a part of our lives, they\'ll probably be a part of us. Intensive wearble devices and even implantable devices leave concern for health. Nobody wants to have an implantable device with a leaky battery. This is one thing Google is focusing on to prepare for the future.Meanwhile, lithium-ion batteries are still not great for stuff like Google Loon, the Internet-broadcasting balloon relays that Google is testing for the developing world. Traditional batteries freeze at high temperatures, and so Google X engineers are coating them in blends of wax and graphite in a way that makes the heat diffuse more evenly.It\'s worth noting that Google\'s other secret research lab, the Google Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) lab led by ex-DARPA chief Dr. Regina Dugan, once scrapped a project that would improve mobile battery life by five times.Which is to say, getting better battery life isn\'t as easy as it may seem. Our computers are getting faster and more powerful by the year, but the batteries that power them just aren\'t keeping pace.',

Now we want our right. No other country has such moral authority ” he said while addressing the Indian community here. “This is an opportunity to recognise a peace loving nation like India ” he said, asking the U N to reconsider its stand on the issue when it celebrates the 70 th anniversary.

Both during the World War II, when 14 lakh Indians went to the battle front, and the World War II, the participation of Indians was immense, he stressed.The world should understand this and change its outlook towards India, he said. India, he noted, had never been an aggressor against any country and firmly believed that the world must be rid of the spectre of war. “Sometimes, history is forgotten.

            u'Mass mobilisation vital for CPI to remain relevant Retrieving the partys organisational strength through mass mobilisation is vital for the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to remain relevant and crucial for effective intervention in the face of the agenda being unveiled by the Narendra Modi government, says Polit Bureau member Sitaram Yechury. Conceding that the party has not been able to retain its electoral and political relevance that peaked between 2004 and 2008 when it could influence the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) policies in favour of the poor, Mr. Yechury said the focus now was on the future. In an exclusive interview to The Hindu ahead of the 21 st Congress of the CPI that starts in Visakhapatnam on Tuesday, Mr. Yechury said: “It is a reality . But we have to look into the future and decide what is to be done.” “Concrete analysis of concrete situations is what Marxism requires,” he said. Mr. Yechury pointed out that the core issues highlighted by the party such as the severe strain on the poor put by the market, secularism, minority rights and democracy were all increasingly critical in the wake of the Modi governments aggressive pursuit of market reforms and its social agenda. “The entire state-patronised pursuit of the Hindutva agenda will retard Indias progress” as “mythology is replacing history and theology is replacing philosophy.”  Accepting that the challenges facing the country today were similar to those in 2004 which led to the formation of UPA 1 , Mr. Yechury ruled out the possibility of any broad coalition with the Congress as the CPI completely disagreed with its economic policy.

Their educational and health status is being used politically. This politics was once played by the Congress and now every other person calls himself secular.”  “If Muslims are only being used this way to play politics, then they can never develop. Muslims will have no future till they are used to play vote bank politics and thus Balasaheb had once said to withdraw Muslims voting rights. What he said is right,” an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said on Sunday.The “secular masks” of all the so-called secular political parties will be worn out, once their voting rights are withdrawn, it said.Taking a dig at AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi for challenging Sena president Uddhav Thackeray to come to Hyderabad, the editorial said, “Owaisi dares us to come to Hyderabad. But we want to ask him if Hyderabad is in India or in Lahore, Karachi or Peshawar. The pride of Marathis is known in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Kandahar as well.” “By saving the hiding place of snakes, you cannot kill them.

            u'Nobody is clean in this ugly war In the conflict within the AAP, the battle has been cast as one between strongly ethical ideologues and practitioners of opportunistic politics. Unfortunately, this is an oversimplification of a fight far more layered and complex Riding a roller coaster will likely be easier than tracking the developments within the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). The avalanche of exposés, letter bombs and sting operations has brought out so much dirt that there is no real way to judge who is right and who is wrong.Yet, two months after Mr. Kejriwals epic conquest of Delhi, it is the rebel duo of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan who appear to have won the perception war.Mr. Kejriwal twice won the battle of numbers  in the February 7, 2015 Delhi Assembly election and then at the March 28 National Council (NC) meeting of the AAP. The NC voted 247 to 10 to oust Mr. Yadav and Mr. Bhushan from the AAPs national executive.Divide within Paradoxically, however, Mr. Kejriwal lost even as he won. In their own way, Mr. Yadav and Mr. Bhushan have outwitted the AAP convener by positioning themselves as the only upholders of principles in a party founded with idealism but now fixated on winning by any means. This narrative, which has enormous urban appeal, has split the party as it has the voters. Indeed, the two men, at least for now, have created a rift between Mr. Kejriwals steadfastly strong underclass support and the educated strata that intermittently joined the core. In the latter groups perspective, Mr. Yadav and Mr. Bhushan constituted a reassuring, stabilising presence in the eager beaver, oftentimes rash, AAP. Mr. Yadav and Mr. Bhushan have always come across as intelligent, patient and reasonable, especially on television, where the average party spokesperson screams rather than speaks. Add to this their already considerable professional reputations  one a reputed social scientist and the other an activist lawyer  and it was clear that in any conflict within the AAP, they had a better chance of being heard by the media and the middle class.Take the NC meeting. The two men emerged from it, looking harried and done in, which immediately set them up as the fall guys. Mr. Kejriwals supporters by contrast seemed uncouth, all brawn and no brain. Mr. Yadav and Mr. Bhushan alleged rowdyism and violence at the NC, charges which were made entirely believable by the lack of transparency in the meeting’s conduct. Mr. Yadav said he was silenced at the NC, folded his palms and apologised to the people: “Believe me, this is not the party I wanted.” TV lapped up the drama.The Kejriwal faction did not bother to weigh in with its own version. Mr. Kejriwal left after his inaugural speech, and his team carried on, unmindful of the commotion outside. To those outside, this conveyed an arrogance completely at odds with the disarming projection of the AAP before the election.Sense of betrayal There is a sense of betrayal among the AAP’s more educated voters, deepened by the daily leaks of accusatory letters. Mr. Yadav and Mr. Bhushan have both written to Mr. Kejriwal, charging him with being a control freak and jettisoning the party’s founding principles; worse, they have said this was a character trait with Mr. Kejriwal, citing many instances, among them Mr. Kejriwal’s habitual disregard of internal decision-making bodies; his attempts to form a government with the Congress, post the AAP’s Lok Sabha debacle; his insistence on awarding the party ticket to defectors and people of disrepute; and his refusal to allow autonomy to State units.Most media opinion has tended to support Mr. Yadav and Mr. Bhushan, projecting them as ideologues too sophisticated to match the goonish, brat pack led by Mr. Kejriwal. This battle has been cast as one between strongly ethical, almost other worldly, ideologues and practitioners of opportunistic politics. And this spin has been so voraciously consumed that it has almost become the definitive story to tell: The man who swept Delhi off its feet is now like any other Machiavellian fixer, defeating his enemies by stealth and ruling over his clan with an iron fist.Internal contradictions Unfortunately, this is an oversimplification of a fight that is far more layered and complex than suggested by the immediate circumstances. Mr. Yadav was the party ideologue but by no means did he advocate pristine, pure politics. He has an understanding of realpolitik drawn from years of studying elections. And the pragmatism that has been attributed to Mr. Kejriwal was originally articulated by Mr. Yadav. Indeed, it was Mr. Yadav who positioned the AAP as a post-ideological party geared to finding solutions and delivering results. A report in the Business Standard (January 9, 2014) quoted him as saying: “We are neither socialists nor capitalists. We are a pragmatic, problem solving party.” Consider another contradiction. Mr. Yadav believes in fighting every election whereas Mr. Kejriwal advocates caution. On Mr. Yadav suggestion, the AAP contested 400 plus Lok Sabha seats, and earned the sobriquet, Zamanat Zapt Party (deposit forfeiting party). Mr. Yadav himself fought from Gurgaon, when as a psephologist, he would have been of greater help in an overseer’s role. On the campaign trail, it was evident that the affable and very polite Mr. Yadav was cutting no ice with the voters. In the event, he came fourth in Gurgaon with his vote share at a dismal seven per cent. The AAP itself was routed in Haryana, belying its publicised image as “destination-next”.The Haryana debacle was a warning that the AAP needed more preparation before trying its luck in the October 2014 Assembly election. But Mr. Yadav and the State unit were set on fighting the election. In the end, the State unit passed a resolution saying it did not want to fight the election without the AAP’s central leadership on board. Mr. Yadav told ANI that Mr. Kejriwal hadn’t “vetoed” the idea of contesting but it was the State unit “which is saying that unless the party chief is with us we do not want to contest.” In other words, the AAP Haryana unit expected Mr. Kejriwal to campaign in the State, diverting his attention from Delhi. An autonomous State unit asking to depend on the national leader is a strange definition of autonomy. Worse still, Mr. Kejriwal was being asked to prioritise a “low yield” State like Haryana over a potentially winning State like Delhi at a critical time.Questions for both sides There are many omissions of procedure where Mr. Yadav and Mr. Bhushan have been equal participants. L\'affaire Somnath Bharti  involving a January 2014 vigilante raid on African women  sent waves of revulsion in Delhi. Mr. Yadav cleared Mr. Bharti, then Law Minister, of any wrongdoing, promising that the party would act on any adverse inquiry finding. The correct course of action would have been to ask Mr. Bharti to step down pending the inquiry report. As it happened, the report found him guilty. Many twists and turns later, the Delhi police are currently awaiting sanction for Mr. Bharti prosecution.As in 2014, so too in 2013, there were defectors and “tainted” candidates in the Delhi election fray. Candidates were imported from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, and there were strong volunteer protests in the case of one candidate, Desh Raj Raghav. The AAPs 2013 ticket distribution committee, which included Mr. Yadav and Mr. Bhushan, overruled the irate volunteers. Journalists ran stories on the “tainted” candidates of 2013, asking significantly: Is winning everything for Kejriwal? A woman MLA, whose candidature was opposed by Mr. Bhushan this time, was also cleared by the 2013 selection committee.Team Kejriwal has a lot to answer for: the sacking of the internal Lokpal, Admiral (retd.) L. Ramdas, opacity in decision-making and encouraging a coterie culture, and so forth.But the rebels have to answer questions too. In a March 2014 interview to The Hindu, Mr. Yadav said he and Mr. Bhushan were clear that Mr. Modi was the AAP’s main opposition. Is it not possible that Mr. Kejriwal was prompted by the same compulsion  to secure Delhi against Mr. Modi  to seek an alliance with the Congress, post the AAP’s Lok Sabha rout? Procedures and principles cannot operate in a vacuum, and Mr. Yadav, the advocate of pragmatic, solution-based politics, ought to know this better than anyone else.Mr. Yadav and Mr. Bhushan have not had one word of praise for Mr. Kejriwal’s superhuman Delhi performance. Nor have they, even once, censured Mr. Shanti Bhushan for nearly destroying the AAP on election eve. In any other party, this would have invited instant disciplinary action.Keywords: Aam Aadmi Party, Arvind Kejriwal, AAP political crisis, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav  ',

            u'Iran deal spells good tidings for India At a time when successful, negotiated outcomes to any intractable international dispute have become a rarity, the understanding reached between Iran and the E3+3 (France, Germany and the United Kingdom + China, the Russian Federation and the United States) is a remarkable achievement. A result of political resolve and deft negotiations, the nuclear deal is set to end over three-and-a-half decades of unremitting hostility between Iran and the U.S.The announced framework restrains Iran’s nuclear programme; it does not eliminate it. It allows Iran access to nuclear energy for exclusively peaceful purposes and a comprehensive release from all sanctions. The spontaneous street celebrations across Iranian cities testified its people’s support for an agreement that will reconnect Iran with the world.Key parameters The details of the agreement currently being drafted will be spelt out by the end of June in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The framework outlines that limits will be placed on Iran’s enrichment capacity, level and stockpiles over the next 10 to 15 years. Iran will maintain no other enrichment facility except the one at Natanz, where it will use only its 6,104 first-generation centrifuges (less than a third of their existing number). Iran’s underground and fortified facility at Fordow, which the U.S. initially wanted to scrap and seal, will be converted into a nuclear physics and technology centre.Iran was building a 40MW heavy water reactor in Arak, fuelled by natural uranium and estimated to produce nine kilogrammes of weapons-grade plutonium annually should Iran acquire reprocessing technology to separate plutonium from the spent fuel. The redesigned Arak plant will ensure it does not produce plutonium. There will be no reprocessing, and the spent fuel will be exported.By providing the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) enhanced access to its nuclear facilities, including full life cycle “cradle to coffin” monitoring of nuclear materials and components, Iran has established its bona fides about abjuring from the acquisition of nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future. In return, Iran shall have access to international cooperation for civilian nuclear energy, including the supply of power and research reactors.Iran’s greatest immediate gain will be the simultaneous termination of the sanctions levied by the six Iran-specific Security Council resolutions as soon as it implements its commitments. Also slated to go are the additional sanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union and some others, which had crippled Iran’s international market access and economy and disrupted its energy, shipping, transportation and financial sectors. If the Congress does not revoke these sanctions, U.S. President Barack Obama might use his waiver authority to free Iran of their effect.Changing regional landscape Iran has gained strategic space, even dominance, in its western periphery, over the last dozen years as the unintended beneficiary of the U.S. intervention in Iraq. With its abundant natural and human resources freed from the burdens of sanctions, Iran’s economy will be unfettered and its potential unlocked. As a consequence, Iran will become more self-assured in its interactions with the world.With mutual enemy images slowly fading  many in the U.S. had regarded Iran as the core of the “axis of evil” and the clergy in Iran had branded the U.S. as “The Great Satan”  the reconfigured U.S.-Iran ties will inevitably restructure the security architecture of the Gulf and the West Asian region. The U.S. will lean on Iran to seek its cooperation in contending with a host of challenges in Iran contiguity, primarily the combat against Daesh in Iraq and Syria, the war in Yemen, and the struggle to establish peace and stabilisation of Afghanistan.Iran’s geostrategic location makes it an intrinsic part of India security and economic space. A stronger and more globally integrated Iran will be an asset for India. India had rightly disregarded the “Statement of Policy” attached to the 2006 Hyde Act enjoining India “to sanction and contain Iran” for its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. Despite critics of India within the U.S. establishment using this as a litmus test for India-U.S. relations, India rejected sanctions not mandated by the Security Council.Implications for India Iran shares its borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan, which contain Islamist terrorist groups that act against both India and Iran. These include the Jundullah, the Lashkar-e-Taiba, and the Haqqani network, in turn associated with the al Qaeda, the Taliban, and even the Pakistan Army. India and Iran, therefore, have a consonance of interests in supporting the stabilisation of Afghanistan. The history of their association goes back to the support they together extended to Commander Ahmad Shah Massoud when he was combating the Taliban. Like India, Iran is constructively invested in Afghanistan and can play a much more significant role there as it gains strength in the post-sanctions period.India and Iran are poised to ink an inter-governmental agreement on the Chabahar port, where India is investing, in the first phase, a modest amount of $85 million to equip two of its existing berths for container and multipurpose cargo shipments meant for Afghanistan. India’s footprint in Chabahar will initially be light and its investment can be stepped up as its cargo potential increases.For decades, India has been exploring connectivity options for Afghanistan, Central Asia, and Russia by the overland route through Iran. Due to lack of a better available option, Indian exporters have begun using the dedicated Chinese facility for exports to Central Asia at the Lianyungang port  this is connected by what China calls its “uninterrupted rail link” to Almaty, along the alignment of the “New Eurasian Land Bridge”, part of its “One Belt One Road” initiative. Iran Bandar Abbas port, conceived as the hub for the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), remains, nevertheless, the shortest and most economical route from India to Central Asia, Russia and Europe.India, Iran and Russia originally signed the INSTC Convention in December 2000, and nine more countries have since joined it. Dry runs conducted last July from the Nhava Sheva port in Maharashtra on two trade routes, one to Astrakhan in Russia, via Bandar Abbas and Amirabad, and another to Baku in Azerbaijan, via Bandar Abbas and Astara, show that these can reduce shipment costs by $2,500 per 15 tons of cargo. India must seize the opportunity to operationalise the INSTC by working with Iran and other interested stakeholders.Energy security As the country holding the world’s fourth largest oil and the second largest natural gas reserves, Iran complements India, currently the world’s fourth-largest consumer and net importer of petroleum products. Iran slipped from the second to the seventh largest source of crude oil imports to India between 2008-09 (21.81 million metric tons) and 2012-13 (13.14 million metric tons). With indigenous production flat at less than a million barrels per day (bbl/d), India oil demand is expected to more than double from its present levels to 8.2 bbl/d by 2040. McKinsey predicts that by 2030, India will have a primary energy import dependence of 51 per cent, compared to one and 20 per cent for the U.S. and China.As India’s most proximate oil exporting country, Iran’s role in India’s energy security remains important. The oversupply and lower prices of oil and gas make India equally valuable to Iran as an assured, long-term buyer. India could take a fresh look at the prospects of a gas pipeline or liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from Iran, as also investing in downstream projects for petrochemicals and gas-based urea plants in Iran. Indian firms need to be more nimble-footed to deal with Western competitors rushing to Iran, as also with Iranian partners adept at driving a hard bargain.India-Iran defence cooperation could be given greater content through a Joint Working Group on defence. This was never set up, though envisioned under a forward-looking India-Iran defence memorandum of understanding (MoU) concluded in 2001. Besides ongoing training and port calls, India could extend its support for hydrography and more intense naval interactions. The established tradition of exchanges between the National Security Councils and Advisors of the two sides could prove useful in this context.A congruence of regional interests does not by itself translate into upgraded strategic relations between India and Iran. It will require patience and persistence  traits possessed by Iranian negotiators in ample measure.Curiously, the key challenge to India will be similar to that which confronts the U.S. and other global and regional powers  how to nurture a relationship with a resurgent Iran, without adversely affecting ties with the Arab-Gulf countries led by Saudi Arabia, and Israel. “The trick,” says a senior Indian official, “is to balance on a three-legged stool  with different sized legs”.India has important equities in Arab-Gulf countries. Collectively, they are home to almost seven million Indians, the largest source of India’s imports, including energy supplies, its second largest export destination, and a growing source of remittances and investments. India will have to demonstrate its diplomatic dexterity in managing this difficult balancing act as it rebuilds its relations with Iran.Keywords: Iran nuclear deal, India-Iran bilateral ties, Iran-world powers nuclear deal, International Atomic Energy Agency   ',

            u'20 woodcutters from TN gunned by A.P. police Twenty woodcutters from Tamil Nadu, found felling red sanders, were killed in an alleged encounter in the Seshachalam forest at the foot of the Tirumala hills on Tuesday.The newly formed Red-sanders Anti-Smuggling Taskforce was on a combing operation near Srinivasa Mangapuram, Srivarimettu and Eethagunta on the Seshachalam hill ranges on Monday when they spotted footprints.One taskforce group moved towards Eethagunta, and the other towards Cheekateegalakona. On finding over 100 woodcutters felling trees and carrying logs, the officials asked them to surrender. However, the woodcutters rained stones and hurled sickles at the team, injuring some of them.“We fired random shots in self-defence,” a taskforce member said on condition of anonymity.A.P. CM briefs Rajnath, Governor Following the encounter in which 20 woodcutters were shot dead by Andhra Pradesh’s red sanders anti-smuggling taskforce, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu held a high-level review meeting with Ministers and top officials. He also spoke over the phone with Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Governor E.S.L Narasimhan and briefed them on the incident.There was tension in some villages in Chittoor district with a large Tamil-speaking population, while about 10 buses of APSRTC (Tirupati region) were damaged at two places in Chennai by mobs apparently in reaction to the gunning down of the woodcutters.Eight of the slain woodcutters were believed to be from Namiyambattu village in Tiruvannamalai district, eight from Sankarapuram in Villupuram district and four from Vellore district of Tamil Nadu.The policemen recovered axes, sickles, red sanders logs and some empty bullet shells from the scene of encounter, apart from four country-made guns reportedly wielded by some of the woodcutters.The A.P. police department was in touch with their Tamil Nadu counterparts to get their identity established.The revenue officials found the task of conducting ‘Panchanama’ daunting, as it was very difficult to reach the spot. Though the district authorities reportedly directed four Tahsildars of the contiguous mandals to rush their staff to the spot to hasten the process, inaccessibility in the form of rocky terrain and the not-so-motorable path, besides the blistering heat, proved a dampener.Keywords: Red sander smuggling, Andhra Pradesh poliice, Chittoor encounter, Seshachalam forest',

            u'Uneasy coalition in the Valley If the BJP-PDP combine does indeed want to make a difference in Jammu and Kashmir,both sides must ignore the troublemakers and focus on the sound agenda they have signed.The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir is past a couple of crucial tests by fire, but it is interesting to look at what its political life will be hereafter. After the controversial release of separatist leader Masrat Alam Bhat and the strident demand for the withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act from the State, the coalition government looked on the brink of collapse. The controversies were not only unfortunate, but also indicative of the deep-seated misconceptions that much of the country seems to share about the State  its unique place in India, the separatist tendencies that refuse to die out, the resistance politics that seems to pass on from one generation to the next, and the limits of conflict resolution. Given that much of the recent Kashmir discourse in India has been ill-informed, it is important that the country’s media houses, especially electronic media houses, and the New Delhi-based strategic community give more serious attention to the State’s politics and conflicts. It was irresponsible for the two sections to have called the Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed a “pro-Pak Chief Minister” and an “anti-national”, especially when he was operating within the ambit of the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) put together by the BJP and the PDP, and with the long-term interest of building peace in Kashmir.The Masrat Alam controversy The Jammu and Kashmir government’s decision to release Mr. Alam, Chairman of the Jammu and Kashmir Muslim League, from Baramulla jail, where he had been incarcerated for close to two decades, was criticised, even though the government was simply acting in accordance with Supreme Court rulings. How can the release of political prisoners from Kashmir’s jails be an anti-national act? In fact, it runs counter to all democratic norms to keep someone under preventive detention for a prolonged period without a proper trial and conviction, or fabricate cases to put him/ her back in prison once the preventive detention period is over. If anything, it would be anti-national to argue that the judiciary should be overruled or circumvented in the name of national security.The BJP’s knee-jerk reaction to the controversy also contributed to the problem. The BJP leadership was simply unwilling to defend its coalition partner. If it were to admit that there are long-term strategic and political benefits to be gained from adopting a ‘healing touch’ policy towards Kashmir, the controversy would have died down. Instead, BJP leaders, including the Prime Minister, cornered by the media hype and pressured by fringe elements within the Sangh Parivar, criticised Mr. Sayeed’s decision to release Mr. Alam without first checking the facts. While Mr. Sayeed did order the release of Mr. Alam from jail, the decision to do so was taken during the Governor’s rule in the State. More pertinently, the BJP’s tendency to put all blame on the PDP when sensitive policy initiatives undertaken by the Jammu and Kashmir government are criticised by the opposition and the media is clearly not in keeping with the norms of coalition politics.PDP’s statements on AFSPA have also often been termed ‘anti-national’, even though there has been a vibrant and well-informed debate in the country on the desirability of the contentious piece of legislation. The Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy Committee unambiguously recommended the repeal of AFSPA, as did the Justice J.S. Verma Committee, which in its 2013 report said that “there is an imminent need to review the continuance of the AFSPA and AFSPA-like legal protocols in internal conflict areas as soon as possible”. If so, why single out the Mufti government, especially when it is widely understood that Mr. Mufti’s humanitarian policy when he was Chief Minister from 2002 to 2005 contributed to some relative peace during that period? The recent terror attacks in the Jammu sector have the potential to hamper the prospects of repealing or amending AFSPA, given that the attacks have put the Mufti government on the back foot. Those against amending or repealing AFSPA should realise that its non-dilution actually benefits the devious designs of the terror outfits themselves: one, it brings a bad name to Jammu and Kashmir; second, the impunity it provides further alienates the people; and finally, it strengthens the argument that Kashmir is not normal, even though the data on violence in the State indicates otherwise.Significance of the CMP The CMP agreed upon by the BJP and PDP as their road map for governance is a well-thought out document with long-term visions and detailed guidelines for implementation. It is unique, as it includes the combined efforts of ideologically opposed parties  the PDP, the BJP and the Hurriyat  to build peace.The CMP makes a number of revolutionary suggestions. The opening paragraph says the alliance is an “effort towards seeking a national reconciliation on J&K ” (emphasis added). On AFSPA, the CMP notes that “the coalition government will examine the need for de-notifying ‘disturbed areas’. This as a consequence, would enable the Union Government to take a final view on the continuation of AFSPA in these areas.” On talks with the Valley’s separatists, the document says that “the coalition government will facilitate and help initiate a sustained and meaningful dialogue with all internal stakeholders, which will include all political groups irrespective of their ideological views and predilections”. It also states that “all lands other than those given to the security forces on the basis of lease, licenses and acquisition under the provision of the Land Acquisition Act shall be returned to the rightful legal owners”. However, these steps are easier imagined than put into practice.The key question is whether the BJP and the PDP can actually work on the CMP without undercutting each other. If they can set aside petty political squabbles, and if their senior leadership can maintain a good working relationship, they can do wonders. On the other hand, if the penchant for mud slinging continues unabated and the BJP disassociates itself from any conflict resolution measures that Mr. Sayeed undertakes in Kashmir, this coalition will not last long. Moreover, it will increase the trust deficit not just between New Delhi and Srinagar, but also between Jammu and Kashmir. Given India’s dangerously unstable geopolitical location, an unsettled Kashmir is not something that New Delhi can afford. One way or another, Kashmir’s stability is central to the country’s national security and well-being.In Jammu and Kashmir, providing economic development and good governance will have to be pursued in tandem with resolving the outstanding political conflicts. If the PDP-BJP government would like to govern well and develop the State, there is a need to first create a conducive political atmosphere. Reaching out to Kashmir’s dissidents should be seen as a major step in that direction, while the BJP should resolve to ignore hypernationalist voices. The nation in general would do well to remember Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s vision of resolving the Kashmir conflict in the spirit of ‘Insaniyat, Jamhooriyat and Kashmiriyat’.    ',

            u'Fight for net neutrality unites internet For once, the constant bickering on the internet and social media has been put aside. People of all beliefs and affiliations have come together to unite on the net neutrality issue, campaigning, persuading, and getting more people involved.In a span of 24 hours, over 27,000 emails have been sent to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) through the website savetheinternet.in responding to the regulator\'s call for public consultation. An online petition on change.org has nearly 150,000 supporters petitioning Union minister for communication and information technology, Ravi Shankar Prasad, the department of telecom, and the TRAI to act against the violation of net neutrality by corporate interests. A visit to the india forum Reddit will show you backroom activities in coordinating online campaigns and debates on the same.Put together by a group of netizens, savetheinternet.in has a ready template response to the 20 questions that TRAI posed in its 118-page long consultation paper on the regulation of over the top (OTT) services, or services that use the internet through telecom service providers (TSPs), like Viber, Skype, Whatsapp etc. This paper is what has prompted the wave of activism online.On savetheinternet.in, one can choose to edit the response before sending it  a two-click process. The answers are in favour of net neutrality and offer arguments against the slicing up of the Internet into various services available at differential prices.The questions pertain to the licensing and regulation of these services, the competition they pose to TSPs by providing the services like calling and texting, and their role in investing in the internet infrastructure. Overall, they cover how different data packets travelling across the internet (voice or text or transactions) should be treated differently, if at all. That is the point central to the net neutrality debate. And as it moves further, questions are also being asked of deals between TSPs and internet companies like Facebook and Wikipedia, wherein their services can be provided to a customer either for free or at a special cost, building a walled garden and making only a part of the internet available to her.Flipkart\'s recent deal with Airtel on the same came in for flak after it was seen as a violation of the net neutrality principle.For those who want to be better informed before taking a stand, there is plenty of reading material on another website, netneutrality.in. Currently, there are people volunteering online to translate the basics of the same into other Indian languages for wider reach."The main problem in the consultation paper is the legalese. I am a programmer, and I don\'t understand this and the industry jargon used in the document. Even if I have to submit it to the TRAI, I don\'t have the vocabulary to do it. We got some lawyers to help with that," says Kiran Jonnalagadda, Bangalore-based techie and co-founder of hasgeek.com, who is behind savetheinternet.in.The questions pertain to the licensing and regulation of these services, the competition they pose to TSPs by providing the services like calling and texting, and their role in investing in the internet infrastructure.

            u'Bandh, massive protest in Karnataka after IAS officer D K Ravi who \'exposed tax frauds\' found dead Anger spilled on to the streets of Karnataka on Tuesday and locals called for a shutdown in Kolar district of Karnataka, following the death of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer D K Ravi, who took on the real estate mafia and \'exposed tax frauds\'.Huge crowds had gathered outside Ravi\'s residence to pay tributes and accompany the IAS officer\'s body on his final journey. There were also protests in different parts of the town with protesters demanding an independent probe into the case. The protests were marked by stray incidents of stone pelting. ​Angry protesters in Kolar district where 35-year-old D K Ravi had taken on the land mafia as deputy commissioner before being posted as joint commissioner of commercial taxes (enforcement) in Bengaluru, also blocked a national highway placing burning tyres before being chased away by police.The house of local MLA in Kolar Varthur Prakash was stoned but police rushed and dispersed the protesters, police said.Exams in the state had also been postponed.The protesters, including some political leaders, are demanding a CBI probe into what they allege is the mysterious death of Ravi, who on his posting in Bengaluru had taken on the land mafia cracking down on them for tax evasion.A 2009 batch IAS officer who was deputed as the Joint Commissioner, State Commercial Taxes Department, D K Ravikumar was found mysteriously hanging by a fan in the bedroom of his private apartment in Tavarekere in South Bengaluru on Monday.Police to probe all angles Bengaluru Police Commissioner M N Reddi, while stating that prima facie it appears to be a suicide, said the dog squad and the forensic science team has been employed to rule out any other cause for his death."As things stand, it appears to be a suicide, and I cannot say anything more as the investigation is still on," Reddi told press persons outside Ravikumars\' apartment, adding that no death note has been found as of now.Neither the police, nor the family has been able to point their fingers at the exact reason for a probable suicide. Ravi, who is not known to leave office during duty hours is said to have reached his apartment as early as 11 am.However, the news of this death only came to light by 6pm on Monday evening, after his wife and family\'s efforts to reach him through the day were futile and they reached the apartment and used a duplicate key to get in.D K Kusuma, his wife has been inconsolable and Reddi said: "The family has not been in a position to answer our questions and quite naturally.

His wife and him stayed in the Tavarekere apartment five days a week and stayed with their relative in Nagarbhavi for two days. On Monday, he had left for office from Nagarbhavi," a senior official investigating the case said.He said that Ravi had not even eaten his lunch which was sent to him and that\'s when his wife and family got suspicious. "They then tried contacting him and upon not being able to reach him, they decided to go to the Tavarekere house," the officer said, and Reddi added that the police presently have no information about who visited his apartment on Monday.The forensic team is yet to determine the exact time of death. We will know that in a couple of hours, as of now it could be anywhere between 11am and 6pm," he said.Ravi, who had become extremely popular as the deputy commissioner of Kolar for his work in ridding encroachments and other "honest" works, was recently transferred to become the joint commissioner of the commercial taxes department.Answering a specific question relating to Ravi\'s problems with work and other matters pertaining to his duties, Reddi said: "...No the information that he had met me a while ago is incorrect and at this time we have no information about him having complained to his seniors about any problem." He, however, said that the investigation will look into all matters. And for this, the police have formed a special team led by DCP South East Rohini Katoch, who is also a (medical) doctor. All senior police officials, home minister K J George and city in-charge minister Ramalinga Reddy visited the spot soon after they learnt of the incident.Reddi said Ravi was a "bold officer" and it was natural for people to think he was not a person to have committed suicide.But, he added, "let us wait for the medical report...no single angle will be untouched.... every angle will be covered."

            u'Supreme Court strikes down Section 66A of IT Act which allowed arrests for objectionable content online The Supreme Court on Tuesday declared Section 66A of Information Technology Act as unconstitutional and struck it down.This section had been widely misused by police in various states to arrest innocent persons for posting critical comments about social and political issues and political leaders on social networking sites.The court said such a law hit at the root of liberty and freedom of expression, two cardinal pillars of democracy.The court said such a law hit at the root of liberty and freedom of expression, the two cardinal pillars of democracy. The court said the section has to be erased from the law books as it has gone much beyond the reasonable restrictions put by the Constitution on freedom of speech. The Supreme Court said section 66A was vaguely worded and allowed its misuse by police.The court, however, upheld the validity of section 69B and the 2011 guidelines for the implementation of the I-T Act that allowed the government to block websites if their content had the potential to create communal disturbance, social disorder or affect India\'s relationship with other countries.However, the court watered down section 79 of the I-T Act making it further difficult for the police to harass innocent for their comments on social network sites.The SC delivered its judgment on a bunch of petitions filed in the light of misuse of the penal provision by government authorities against persons who allegedly uploaded offensive posts on social networking sites.The petitioners, including NGOs, civil rights groups and a law student, had argued that Section 66A violated citizens\' fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. The first petition was however filed by a law student Shreya Singhal.The government had said the provision could not be quashed just because of its potential misuse. Posting pictures and comments on social networking sites which hurt religious sentiments could not be tolerated and people must be prosecuted, it said.Former attorney general Soli J Sorabjee, who appeared for one of the petitioners, termed the judgment a \'glorious vindication\' of right to free speech. He spoke to the TOI after SC bench of Justices J Chelameswar and R F Nariman struck down section 66A as unconstitutional. Sorabjee said: "The judgment is well researched, well reasoned and erudite in expression. It is a glorious vindication of freedom of expression."   ',

            u'How Narendra Modi reworked Rafale deal, and why it’s a winner Two themes dominated Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s decision to do an outright buy of 36 Rafale fighter aircraft from France  national security and cutting through bureaucratic red tape. In the process, India was able to get better terms for the fighters, which has been hanging fire for the past few years.The Indian Air Force has been raising red flags over the appalling lack of India\'s defence preparedness for some time. But this time, the Air chief received a sympathetic hearing from the PM. While it was the same shortcoming that had prompted the Rafale deal in the first place, the subsequent tortuous negotiations meant that the deal had less and less chances of going through.Between the Dassault-HAL mistrust, looming liability issues that Dassault flagged for the 108 aircraft supposed to be built in India, and rising lifecycle costs for the aircraft, it was threatening to become one of those famous defence quagmires that have regularly bedeviled Indian defence procurement.India was not only in danger of not getting the Rafale, but not getting anything else either because nobody would be able to actually scrap the deal without incurring penalties. It would have been a festering sore that would have impacted India-France relations.Modi\'s pact ensured better price for Rafale jets Late last year, the Indian government decided to look at other options on how to get the necessary aircraft without raising hackles or having the deal questioned. The Modi government decided to cut through the red tape, which included everything from offset rules to pricing. Abandoning the \'Make in India\' mantra for 36 planes, Modi was able to do two things.First get a better price from France for the 36 planes because they are a direct G2G buy and do not involve technology transfer. Secondly, there was also no question of going back to the drawing board to re-issue the RFP (Request for Proposal) which would have added to the delay and could attract unnecessary criticism, political opposition and allegations of corruption, which this government is keen to avoid.A national security assessment also highlighted the growing uncertainty in India\'s neighbourhood not only with its traditional challenges of China and Pakistan, but the growing instability in India\'s western neighbourhood. An aggressive China could also be unpredictable and any potential conflict with India\'s northern neighbour would be all about air power.China, because of its arms embargo, cannot access the kind of weapons that India can  but in the past few years, Beijing has ramped up its fighter aircraft production with a lot of help from Russia. With its deep pockets and near absent bureaucratic delays on defence production, China would soon have an unbeatable edge over India.Meanwhile, Dassault itself was having problems, until they got a shot in the arm with Egypt ordering 24 Rafale jets off the shelf in February for $5.9 billion, a much higher price than negotiated by India for 126 aircraft. This gave them the ability to continue negotiations with India while they worked on the Egypt order. It would mean that India would add several years to its already long waiting period to get the aircraft. In the meantime, Indian Air Force would continue its downward spiral.French defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian visited India in December and in February after India indicated it would seriously relook at overcoming the hurdles for Rafale. India sent a number of teams to France to complete the negotiations in time for the PM\'s visit. As in the India-US nuclear deal, negotiations went down to the wire, with Indian officials negotiating the minutiae of the deal as late as late last week.The order for 36 jets, double the original number, was used by the government to drive a harder bargain with France. The government was persuaded to pressure Dassault to fast track delivery, and secure better terms for servicing and maintenance besides spares. The political heavy lifting was spearheaded by the PM, including the internal decision to slice away at the red tape.Sources said the earlier deal on 108 aircraft to be manufactured in India still stands and would be renegotiated with Dassault incorporating the new terms agreed on. It\'s not yet clear whether government entity HAL would be the Indian manufacturer or whether with the liberalized defence production norms, it could be someone else. For the moment, India will continue to hold the French feet to the fire for swift delivery of the aircraft.The government has already announced the two new squadrons would be inducted into the IAF in two years.The India-France joint statement said the order for the 36 jets would be "on terms that would be better than conveyed by Dassault Aviation as part of a separate process underway".

            u'Previous government \'gave away\' coal mines like it was a handkerchief: Modi Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the previous government of "giving away" coal mines as easily as one would give a pen, a handkerchief or even a piece of paper. And his government through the auctioning of just 20 of the 204 coal mines had got Rs.2 lakh crore.Addressing a civic reception by the Indian diaspora, Modi said that "204 coal mines were just given away like, "come and take my pen, take this hanky, this piece of paper" but even while giving a pen you will think twice, but the 204 coal mines were just given away", he alleged."A storm was kicked up... the court raised the issue and it even went up to that of the prime minister," he said referring to the CBI court summons to former prime minister Manmohan Singh in the coal allocation issue. "But I don\'t want to indulge in criticism, but the Supreme Court then waved the stick (on the issue)," he said.Modi said when the CAG pegged the loss from coal allocation at Rs. 1lakh 76,000 crore "No one believed it"."But when we auctioned, only 20 of the 204 mines were auctioned. And we got Rs.2 lakh crore. Only 10 percent of the work has been done, and the treasury has got Rs.2 lakh crore," he said."If any government does this then the people will say that run the government for 25 years," Modi said to loud cheers.He said the government has decided that the money will go to the respective state government, for making factories, for education and infrastructure projects."Gujarat does not have coal mines, or the newspapers would have criticized the move," he said.The coal auction money would go to Odisha, Bihar, Jharkahnd, West Bengal "where there is possibility of progress, and I have to take them forward", he said.He said through the Jan Dhan projects 14 crore people have got bank accounts, which is bigger than the population of France.Modi said the government has given cooking gas subsidy to 13 crore bank accounts, adding that it helped end corruption.He also referred to his move of "give it up", urging the well-off people to give up their cooking gas cylinder subsidy."And I have seen that 2 lakh people of their own volition have stopped taking subsidy... If you are well off, give it up, now 3.5 lakh people have left it, now we are saving money," he said.Modi said the money the government got through this would be transferred to the accounts of those who still use stoves that use wood so that they can buy cooking cylinders."Climate change will be tackled this way," he said.

            u'U.S. and Israel too criticise Lakhvi release U.S. govt. said it had communicated its "grave concerns" over Lakhvi’s release to senior Pakistani officials, after he was granted bail.After France, the U.S. and Israel have criticised the decision of a Pakistani court to free the alleged mastermind of the 26/11 attack, Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi.The U.S. government said it had communicated its “grave concerns” over Lakhvi’s release to senior Pakistani officials on Thursday, after he was granted bail. “Pakistan has pledged cooperation in bringing the perpetrators, financiers and sponsors of the Mumbai terrorist attacks to justice, and we urge Pakistan to follow through on that commitment to ensure justice for the 166 innocent people, including six Americans, who lost their lives,” State Department spokesperson Jeff Rathke said in Washington.Asked whether the U.S. would consider any action against Pakistan, Mr. Rathke said: “Bringing the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks to justice is a key priority…So we’ll continue working in that direction, but I don’t have any further specific steps to outline right now.” In a statement issued in Delhi, Israeli Ambassador Daniel Carmon said Israel was “surprised and disappointed” by the release of Lakhvi, calling him the “mastermind” of the attacks. Four Israelis, including two Israeli Americans, were among those killed during the attack on Chabad House. Among them were Rabbi Gavriel and his wife Rivkah, directors of the Jewish centre, who were allegedly gunned down by LeT terrorists on orders delivered on the phone from Lakhvi, who was manning the ‘Karachi control room’ during the three-day siege.“This release is a setback for the international efforts in the war against terror, in which India and Israel are close partners,” Mr. Carmon said.On Friday, the release of Lakhvi was discussed between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Francois Hollande in Paris. Mr. Hollande, too, condemned the development, saying it wasn’t “good for India and the world.” Without referring directly to Pakistan and Lakhvi’s release, Mr. Modi said there was need for “global action to deal with terrorism” and called on nations to “commit that they will not provide shelter to terrorists but punish them.” India had reacted sharply, with a strong protest being delivered by High Commissioner T.C.A. Raghavan in Islamabad. In response, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said Indian delays in “extending cooperation” to investigators were responsible for the “weaknesses” in the prosecution case.Keywords: Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi, Lakhvi release, Mumbai attacks mastermind ',

I apologised to the family and told them that I will visit immediately and I have done so on Saturday.”  Asked why he had not made the visit on April 6 as scheduled by him, Khattar claimed it was “due to bad weather” but Chhoker questioned it, saying the weather was fine on that day. Mr. Chhoker’s remarks that an official at the CM’s residence had spoken rudely to him when he enquired about the programme, Mr. Khattar said: “It is not like that. I know my people.

Union Minister General (retd) V.K.

They were not able to subdue me when I was the Army chief. They have carried on,” Gen. Singh said and accused a former senior Army official of being a part of the conspiracy. “I won’t go beyond saying as to what relationships he enjoys with various chaps. There are a lot of people who were paid by him. So, obviously, you have some journalists and others who will write what they are told,” he said.

            u'Delhi power distribution companies demand 20 per cent hike in power tariff The power tariff in the national capital may see a steep rise of up to 20 per cent if Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) accepts a demand of the three private power distribution companies which have strongly sought the hike citing severe fund crunch. Currently, the DERC is in the process of reviewing the power tariff for 2015-16 and has hinted that it may go up notwithstanding AAP government’s firm position against any increase. Sources said the three private power distribution companies have sought up to 20 per cent hike in tariff to meet rising cost of power procurement.They said Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd has sought around 20 per cent increase in tariff while BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL) and BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd (BRPL) have demanded a hike of 19 per cent and 16 per cent respectively.Power Regulator DERC, a quasi-judicial body, is likely to announce revised power rates next month after taking views of all the stakeholders including resident welfare associations and the discoms.The AAP government had asked DERC to explain a series of hikes it effected in the last couple of years and indicated to it not to hike the tariff again till the Comptroller and Auditor General completed audit of the discoms.However, DERC refused to follow Delhi government’s diktat and decided to go ahead with the tariff determination process, arguing that the commission was “totally independent” to review the rates.The private power distribution companies have already conveyed to DERC that “absence of cost reflective tariff and denial of Power Purchase Adjustment Cost (PPAC) for last few months have depleted their financial positions”.The PPAC, which was introduced four years ago to help the discoms adjust their power purchase cost, was discontinued by the regulator five months ago.As per DERC figures, the two BSES discoms have a revenue gap of around Rs 10,000 crore between 2009-2013.According to power experts, cost of buying power by Delhi discoms has increased by around 300 per cent since 2002 though the retail tariff has risen by only around 90 per cent which has put strain on finances of the discoms.Officials in Power Department said the three discoms had put the revenue gap till current year to around Rs 27,000 crore.According to official figures, around 80-90 per cent of total revenue of discoms goes into purchasing power from central and state government owned entities through long term power purchase agreement, at rates determined by the central and state regulators.The cost of buying power has increased primarily on account of an increase in the input prices of raw material like coal and gas, officials said.The AAP government is of the view that the power tariff should not be hiked till CAG completes its audit of the discoms. Power tariff was a major issue for AAP during the campaign for Delhi polls.The Kejriwal government had announced a 50 per cent subsidy on monthly power consumption of up to 400 units in February till the government receives the CAG report.In its first stint, the AAP government had ordered a CAG audit of all the three discoms, claiming that they have been misleading the government and the DERC about their financial position.The city has seen a series of hike in power tariff in the past few years.The tariff was hiked by 22 per cent in 2011 followed by five per cent hike in February 2012. The tariff was increased by up to two per cent in May 2012 and again by 26 per cent for domestic consumers in July 2012.It was hiked by up to three per cent in February 2013 and again by five per cent in August last year. It was again enhanced up to seven per cent in November last year.   ',

While elections were held for 40 seats, the BPF won 20 in comparison to 33 it had won in 2010. BPF chairman Hagrama Mohilary said the BPF would form the council for the third consecutive term, this time taking support of some independent members. While the BPF won 20 seats, the People’s Committee for Democratic Rights (PCDR), an umbrella of body of several organizations backed by the all Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU) won seven. The BPF, which had had a cakewalk in the 2005 and 2010 Council elections, faced a tough contest this time, especially from the PCDR.The AIUDF too has made its entry into the Bodoland Territorial Council by winning four seats, and the BJP one. While seven independents backed by the Abodo Suraksha Samiti have also made it to the Council apart from one unattached independent, the Congress, AGP and CPI(M) have all drawn blank.This was the first time since formation of the BTC following the Bodo Accord of 2003 that national parties like the Congress, BJP and CPI(M) had contested in the elections. The AGP had won one seat in 2010, but drew blank this time. The BTC has 46 members, of which 40 are elected and six nominated from communities that remain unrepresented.Failure of the Congress to win even one seat and that of the BJP to make any major presence in the Bodoland Council have both proved that the Bodos continue to remain detached from national or even regional parties. The BPF, which was an ally of the Congress party in the state assembly since 2006 had withdrawn support to the Congress after it lost the Kokrajhar Lok Sabha seat to a former ULFA leader backed by the Sanmilita Janagosthiya Aikyamancha, a platform of non-Bodo communities living in the four districts that constitute the Bodoland Council.

            u'Denied books, uniform, poor children can’t return to school The new school session may have begun 10 days ago for most students, but for seven out of 10 children studying under the economically weaker sections (EWS) category in the city’s many private schools, studying in a new class has become impossible without any books or uniform.Delhi’s Right to Education rules require schools to provide free books and uniforms to children belonging to the EWS category, but schools say they are “under no obligation” to provide them books and uniform.There are 68,951 EWS students in Delhi and, according to an affidavit submitted by the directorate of education in the High Court, 51,000 of them are left without books and uniform. “School authorities have told us to get books and uniform on our own and that the school was under no obligation to provide us anything. The total cost of books for both my children comes to around Rs 9,000. I cannot afford to pay so much, so my children are staying at home till the time I can save the amount,” Rakesh, whose son and daughter are enrolled in a popular school in Rohini, told Newsline.Quoting Section 3(2) of the RTE Act, the Supreme Court in 2011 ruled that barriers, including financial ones, which prevented children from getting quality education should be removed. Section 8(1) of the Delhi Right to Education Act also states that entitlements  including books and uniform and writing material  have to be provided by schools.Noting that it was “wholly unacceptable” on the government’s part for nearly 51,000 children to go without books and uniform, the High Court had said last year that “it was the duty of the government as well as schools to ensure that free textbooks are provided to children”. But with the entitlement amount per child that is given by the government being too low to meet all costs, schools say they are not under any obligation to give out anything.“The government pays a little more than Rs 600 for each child’s books and uniform. The amount is hardly enough to compensate us. We can’t be expected to pay lakhs of rupees from our own pockets,” R C Jain, president, Delhi State Public Schools’ Management Association, said. The government gives Rs 1,290 per child per month to private schools in all.The High Court had agreed to admit the issue of how much entitlement the government should pay. It had also asked the government “to take action with regards to supplying free books and uniforms without awaiting further orders”.Despite clear provisions in the RTE Act, Delhi RTE rules and orders from the Supreme Court and the High Court, it is unfortunate that poor children are still being deprived,” Khagesh Jha, advocate Justice for All, said.

JD(U) green signal to the merger was given at a meeting of MLAs, MLCs and MPs at the residence of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar late last night. Sharad Yadav was not present in the meeting. “All the Legislators and Parliamentarians unanimously welcomed the merger move and authorised JD(U) President Sharad Yadav and CM Nitish Kumar to carry the exercise ahead,” Bihar Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shrawan Kumar said on Thursday.Shrawan Kumar, a close aide of CM Nitish Kumar, told PTI that Kumar briefed members about progress made so far in the process of merger and need for it to take on BJP. The participants urged the CM to speed up merger exercise to which Kumar told them that Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav has been authorised to call a meeting soon for formal announcement of merger of six parties into Janata Parivar.The six parties involved in merger are Samajwadi Party, RJD, JD(U), JD(S), INLD and Samajwadi Janata Party. RJD President Lalu Prasad has already announced approval of his party on merger after a national executive meeting of the party in Patna on Sunday last.Meanwhile, as the pace of merger is gathering momentum, a rebel JD(U) MLA Rajib Ranjan has faxed a letter to Chief Election Commissioner that he and a few other Legislators were unwilling to be part of merger and would like to remain in Janata Dal (United) itself. In a letter faxed to CEC last evening, Ranjan, JD(U) MLA from Islampur in Nalanda district, requested him to order that the arrow symbol of JD(U) and its flag remain with the parent body.Ranjan, a fellow casteman of CM Nitish Kumar and who also hails from his native Nalanda district, has been siding with former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi.

One of the agitating members even carried a placard saying “Big No  AFSPA’’.The BJP legislators were protesting against the recent terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, including the one in which three policemen were killed in Shopian on Monday.Significantly, the protest came a day after Chief Minister Mufti Sayeed  who also holds the Home portfolio  in a written reply to a question from National Conference legislator Devender Rana, said: “Keeping in view the improving security scenario, the state government will examine the need for de-notifying disturbed areas which have been free from militancy-related incidents for quite some time so as to enable a phased withdrawal of AFSPA from such areas’’.However, the disruptions by BJP legislators during the Question Hour drew angry protests from the opposition benches as members of NC and Congress stood up, while Independent Legislator Engineer Rashid rushed into the Well.After nearly 10 minutes when order was restored in the House, Nawang Rigzin Jora of Congress took a jibe on BJP legislators for their opposition to revocation of AFSPA when Chief Minister Mufti Sayeed said it would be revoked.

            u'Rebalancing acts Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena’s four-day visit to China was part of a delicate balancing act being executed by Colombo. Under former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka had drifted close to China in ways that made it seem unconcerned about India’s sensitivities. There was no progress on the Tamil question. Sri Lanka also hosted two Chinese submarines last year, which made New Delhi apprehensive about its security and contributed to its reservations about the Chinese Maritime Silk Road (MSR) project. In January’s general elections, the opposition front led by Sirisena had promised a more “balanced” foreign policy. Sirisena thus made India his first foreign destination as president last month and Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid a quick return visit this month. In the event, Sirisena’s visit to China was an indication that while Colombo would like to nuance its ties with Beijing, it would not like to alienate China.India, however, was not the only factor that has compelled a recalibration of Sri Lanka’s foreign policy. It also has to do with domestic dynamics. China got too closely identified with an increasingly unpopular Rajapaksa and the opposition came to view China’s investments in Sri Lanka as evidence of crony capitalism. Sirisena’s alliance, for instance, not only alleged that the interest rates on Chinese loans were too high but also raised questions about the financial viability of ventures such as the $1.5 billion Colombo Port City project, which Sirisena suspended pending a review of environmental and corruption issues.Over the last few years, Beijing had invested heavily in cultivating Rajapaksa and begun pumping investments into a variety of projects, including a greenfield port in Hambantota. Given its critical location in the Indian Ocean and centrality to building Xi’s ambitious MSR project, China also views Sri Lanka from the strategic perspective. In fact, the Colombo Port City project is thought to be key to the MSR, and Colombo has contradicted reports about its readiness to resume it. Unsurprisingly, Xi appeared to underscore China’s commitment to Sri Lanka and cautioned Sirisena about abandoning Beijing’s projects. As Colombo seeks to recast ties with Beijing, Delhi must recognise that China will not easily let go of the neighbourhood. Its success in getting Nepal to toe its line on Tibet and the Dalai Lama at the Boao forum, which Sirisena also attended during his China visit, is another indication of the persistence of the “China card” in South Asian geopolitics. While China will continue to loom large in Sri Lanka, India’s real challenge is to rapidly consolidate its own strategic and economic partnership with Colombo and also address the Tamil issue with sensitivity.

            u'Under Narendra Modi, the BJP has pointedly abjured the genetic transmission of power, access and benefit, an embarrassing hallmark of the South Asian flavour of democracy. The party’s rhetoric essentially states that a tea-seller can legitimately aspire to rule so long as he or she delivers good governance, and that nothing else ought to matter. So the BJP should be deeply embarrassed by the case of Sanjay Singh, a brother-in-law  though somewhat distant  of three-time Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh, who shot up from a Grade III officer to a general manager for tourism in the state. Within the administration, his rise was red-flagged and disparaged in file notings, but continued. Despite the protestations of Raman Singh’s government, which has earned general admiration for streamlining the delivery of services, this is an instance of the cronyism which distorts the political process and hampers development.One of the core strategies that  Modi attempts to bring to government is the reduction of the possibility of discretion by depersonalising and abstracting the processes through which institutions relate to each other, and through which government and citizens interact.Transparency discourages discretionary behaviour, too, and together they provide a means to sunder the unholy marriage of patronage and cronyism. Whether the matter at issue is the auction of a natural resource like coal or spectrum, or the unusual career of a government employee, process abstraction and transparency are necessary to even the playing field.Raman Singh has been in office for over a decade, and it would be quite unfair to expect his kin to restrain themselves from gainful employment all that while. However, they must draw critical attention if their gains are out of proportion, especially when the government is run by a party which rejects the history of family values. Of course, a family relationship is only a special instance of the web of connections that routinely subverts the process by which the government disburses benefit and opportunity. Whether it is the embarrassing rise of the brother-in-law in Chhattisgarh or the Vyapam scam in Madhya Pradesh, another showpiece state of the BJP, the antidote is the same  the discouragement of discretion.

            u'Secular martyrs I am Avijit”, wrote Dhaka student Wasiqur Rahman Babu on his Facebook page after the murder of Bangladeshi-American writer Avijit Roy in February, “words cannot be killed”. Babu’s killing, on Sunday, has made clear the darkening threat that Bangladesh’s Islamists pose to the country’s intelligentsia. Executed in a savage attack on Monday, which the police say was likely carried out by the al-Qaeda affiliated Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), the killing was just the latest in a long, grim series. The ABT’s death squads first executed Ahmed Rajib Haider, among the architects of the anti-Islamist Shahbag protests, in February 2013. This was followed by the killing of Rajshahi University social scientist Shaiful Islam Lilon and Daffodil University student Ashraful Alam.The men were all linked to Facebook pages and blogs where young progressives in Bangladesh have grouped together to take on the country’s religious right-wing  fearlessly critiquing religion, social norms and politics. For Islamists, this has proved to be an intolerable threat. In each case, the victims were slaughtered with meat-knives, their heads and necks slashed in a manner mimicking the ritual executions conducted by the Islamic State. In Facebook posts, the ABT has promised there will be more blood spilt: of atheists, and those it considers apostates.For the country, this is a moment of truth. The political struggle underpinning the killings is, in many ways, as significant as the one that unfolded in 1971. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government, pushed by secularists to ensure the trial of independence war criminals, has ended up posing an existential threat to Islamists  coddled by successive governments since the assassination of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in 1975. In the wake of the assassination, General Ziaur Rahman’s government initiated a process of Islamisation. The Jamaat-e-Islami, the spearhead of Pakistani rule, was reborn as an empire, controlling welfare organisations, charities, hospitals and educational institutions rivalling those of the state. The secularist tide Hasina is riding threatens to undermine the Jamaat project. Though the government has come down hard on political Islamists, making it near-impossible for them to mobilise politically, the jihadists have carried forward their agenda by spilling blood. The Bangladesh government has acted, with commendable resolve, to take on terrorists. India must back this struggle, with all the means at its disposal.',

            u'A breakthrough Negotiations have finally led to a provisional nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. The framework agreement, announced after intensive talks extended beyond the self-imposed deadline of March 31, seeks to restrict Iran’s nuclear programme and prevent Tehran from making a nuclear weapon, in return for a phased easing of sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy. The longstanding nuclear dispute between Iran and the West had entered a new phase when new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called for the resumption of serious negotiations in August 2013, followed by a phone conversation between Rouhani and US President Barack Obama the next month.An interim deal was announced in November 2013 but the road to the framework agreement has been long and winding. The P5+1 and Tehran now face weeks of detailed drafting, which must produce a final agreement by the June 30 deadline. Critical for the international community is the Iranian “break-out” time  the time needed to detect and respond to an attempt to subvert the deal and push for weapons-grade enrichment of fissile material. That period appears to be a year  better than the two-three month window that critics had feared.The nuclear dispute has been part of the larger political confrontation between the US and Iran since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. A final deal promises to transform a Middle East facing newer threats to stability, such as the Islamic State, which is casting Washington and Tehran on the same side. It will not, however, resolve all outstanding disagreements between the two, a fact borne out by the conflicts in Yemen or Syria, for instance. For both Rouhani and Obama, the real challenge hereafter is to sell the deal to its opponents in Washington and Tehran. While Rouhani will have to battle the Iranian hardliners, Obama has the tougher job of convincing the Republicans, America’s Arab allies and Israel  all extremely hostile to the deal. He has been bold so far in constructing a new, realistic approach to the Middle East.India has done well to immediately welcome the deal. It needs to support the process of rapprochement between the US and Iran, which will also open diplomatic space for New Delhi in the Middle East. Iran is intrinsic to Delhi’s concerns about energy security and Afghanistan. India must now prepare to deal with a rebalanced Middle East, a region that has not received adequate attention in the recent past. A prime ministerial visit to the region, long overdue, will help.    ',

It is also difficult to believe that the Government has decided to brave farmers anger, street protests and media criticism to get the amendment Bill passed by Parliament. But that is how the story is unfolding. Prime Minister Modi is leading the Governments campaign in support of the Bill to amend the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act 2013 (LARR Act). Mr Venkaiah Naidu, Minister of Urban Development, gives a byte a day. Mr Arun Jaitley, Minister of Finance, is confrontational one day and conciliatory the next. Mr Birender Singh, Minister of Rural Development (who will pilot the Bill) is, for the most part, silent. Reports indicate that the RSS and its affiliated organisations are divided on the Bill. The old Land Acquisition Act of 1894 was an oppressive and exploitative colonial legislation. It took free India 66 years to repeal that Act and pass a law that was vastly superior in terms of fairness and justice to the many stakeholders. That the law was passed nearly unanimously, with the support of the principal opposition party (BJP), was a tribute to the collective wisdom of Parliament. It, therefore, came as a bolt from the blue that the new Government, within six months of coming into office, took up amending the LARR Act as one of its priorities. The Government advised the President to promulgate an ordinance on the midnight of December 31, 2014. I commented on the ordinance in a column that was published in this newspaper on January 18, 2015 (Stand up and be counted).

The latest policy statement has clearly given indication if the price behaviour is along the trajectory envisage I expect probably changes will come in the early part of next year.

Rangarajan was here to deliver the inaugural address during a seminar organized by the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology. Replying to a query on falling oil prices, he said net oil importing countries such as India will benefit from the situation in terms of reducing current account deficit. He predicted that if the situation continues, the CAD will be in the range of 1.7 per cent of the GDP as that of last year. "Well, the initial expectation was because of the fall in oil prices, the CAD may be even lower than last year. But because of the pick-up of gold imports and all that I expect the CAD to be the same as the last year ... something like 1.75 per cent of the GDP," the former RBI governor said.

            u' Any talk of privatizing Air India would be "premature" at this stage even as there is a need to re-visit its Turnaround Plan (TAP) in view of the changing micro-economic situation, top sources in AI Board have said.They said that the advisory panel, which the government is mulling setting up for the national carrier, should have academicians and independent analysts as its members for a "fair" and "objective" assessment of its viability as a national carrier. "It would be too early to talk about privatisation of Air India at this stage. What you actually need is a complete re-look at the airline revival plan and then decide whether it should remain with the State or go to private hands," a source told PTI here. Noting that the micro-economic situation has gone a sea change since 2012, when the government had approved its turnaround plan, the source said, "No one had imagined crude oil prices would fall or foreign direct investment by the foreign airlines would be allowed in domestic airlines." The comments came in the backdrop of media reports that some of the AI independent directors were pushing for its privatization and had even communicated their views to the civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju in this regard recently. The erstwhile UPA dispensation had in 2012 approved Air turnaround plan, with a committed public funding of Rs 30,231 crore, staggered over a period of nine years, with some specific riders. Emphasizing that the state-run carrier has shown a marked improvement in its finances in the last fiscal and has met some of the key targets as stipulated in the TAP, the source said, "One has to consider all these factors and then a take a pragmatic view on the whole issue." The airline in its budget estimates for this fiscal, presented late last month, has forecast that it would become operationally profitable by March next year, much ahead of the TAP projections'

            u' London listed Vedanta group of NRI metals mining tycoon Anil Agarwal has slapped a  against the government of India, challenging a Rs 20,497 crore tax claim against its Indian subsidiary, Cairn India, using retrospective law.This is the second claim being field against the government over the tax notice. On Tuesday, Cairn Energy plc, which had in 2011 sold a majority stake in Cairn India to Vedanta group for 8.67 billion, sought compensation for the loss in value it suffered due to an "unfair and arbitrary" demand for Rs 10,247 crore.Vedanta filed the notice against the income tax department move to impose Rs 20,497 crore in taxes and penalties on Cairn India for allegedly failing to deduct tax on capital gains made by its former parent, Cairn Energy plc, while doing a business reorganization seven years back.Cairn Energy had in 2006-07 transferred its India assets, including the Barmer oilfields in Rajasthan, to a new company Cairn India and listed it on the stock exchanges.Finance ministry sources said this was legacy issue it had inherited from the UPA regime, which imposed the retrospective law in 2012 to tax share transfers, and no new notices were being issued under this law.Vedanta said it would take "all necessary steps" to protect its interest against the tax notice on Cairn India. board of directors has instructed counsel to file a notice of claim against the GoI under the UK-India bilateral investment treaty (BIT) in order to protect its legal position and shareholder interests," Vedanta said in a filing to the London Stock Exchange. Cairn India too has informed the bourses of the filing by Vedanta."If enforced, such tax demand would have serious consequences for Cairn India and therefore Vedanta investment in Cairn India," the metal, mining and oil major said.Vedanta said the claim notice was the first step required prior to commencement of international arbitration pursuant to the BIT. "Vedanta and Cairn India will continue to take all necessary steps to protect their interest and the interest of their shareholders. "The government has also made a parallel tax demand on Cairn UK Holdings, for which the Edinburgh-based company has sought arbitration and is seeking compensation under the UK-India investment treaty. The company has been advised by leading international counsel that the retrospective tax legislation passed is a violation of protections accorded to investors under the BIT and constitutes a serious impairment of the treaty rights of Vedanta, it said. Cairn Energy of the UK also recently sought compensation from the Government of India for the loss in value it suffered due to an "unfair and arbitrary" Rs 10,247 crore tax demand raised using a retrospective tax law. Cairn argued that the imposition of capital gains tax on transfer of its India assets to Cairn India was not only contrary to relevant legal standards but unjust because it was an internal transaction and no shares or assets were sold to any third party to make any capital gains.'

However, this decline is not necessarily a sign of sluggish overall personal computer sales long term. Mobile personal computers, including notebooks, hybrid and Windows tablets, grew compared with a year ago."The first quarter results support our projection of a moderate decline of personal computer shipments in 2015, which will lead to a slow, consistent growth stage for the next five years," Gartner said. "Desk-based personal computer shipments declined rapidly, with business desk-based personal computers being impacted the most. Mobile personal computers are being driven by a separate underlying replacement cycle, which led mobile growth in the first quarter. Personal computer replacements will be driven by thin and light notebooks with tablet functionality. Our early study suggests strong growth of hybrid notebooks, especially in mature markets, in quarter one of 15," Gartner said. '

        (u'The two century old Shree Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai devoted to the Hindu elephant headed god Ganesha bristles with close circuit cameras and is guarded by 65 security officers. It is one of richest temples, having amassed 158 kg of gold offerings, worth and its heavily guarded vaults are strictly off the limits.A few years ago a treasure of gold worth an billion was discovered in secret vaults in the Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple in Kerala. Now, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to get his hands on this temple gold, estimated at about 3,000 tonnes, more than two thirds of the gold held in the US bullion depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky, to help tackle India chronic trade imbalance. Modi government is planning to launch a scheme in May that would encourage temples to deposit their gold with banks in return for interest payments. The government would melt the gold and loan it to jewellers to meet an insatiable appetite for gold and reduce economically crippling gold imports, which accounted for 28% of India trade deficit in year ending March 2013. India is the world biggest consumer of gold and its ancient temples have collected billions of dollars in jewellery, bars and coins over the centuries all hidden securely in vaults, some ancient and some modern. India annual gold imports of 800 to 1,000 tonnes could be cut by a quarter if temples decided to participate in the scheme, say government and industry sources. "We would be happy to deposit our gold to nationalised banks if the policy is beneficial, safe and earns good interest," said Narendra Murari Rane, chairman of the trust for the Siddhivinayak temple, portions of which are gold plated. But some Hindu devotees are not happy with the idea that their offerings could be melted down. A Mumbai based gold merchant, who said he and his father had donated around 200 kg of gold to Siddhivinayak and other temples over the years, said it would be a sin for the temples to earn interest on the gold offered to the gods. "I make donations to God; not to any temple trust," the 52-year-old merchant said. Modi would also like to convince Indians to open their family vaults, which hold an estimated 17,000 tonnes of gold in jewellery and other heirlooms. But it will be much harder to convince Indian families, who sometimes have little faith in financial institutions, to break tradition and hand over gold passed down the generations. Indias love affair with gold spans centuries and is rooted in the Hindu religion. One of the biggest annual buying seasons is the Diwali festival around October to November. Gold marriage dowries are widespread and with 70% of the population rural, gold is financial security.'

But very much looking forward to working with him,î said the 25-year-old player.Making the switch between formats may be different for a player but not for Boult, who enjoys the change. ìI donít think so. I guess similar things apply but only for a shorter period. For me the game plan is still very similar. I want to keep taking wickets and pitch the ball up and make it swing. I donít think too much has changed, I have played a lot of T20 cricket,î he said.Many players have made it to their respective national teams after an IPL stint but Boult comes to the cash-rich competition already as a Kiwi star.I wouldnít say that I am a star. I am just loving my cricket and am very passionate about it. I love every opportunity to showcase my skills and to finally be out here in the IPL and on the biggest stages of the world, in front of a big crowd I canít wait to get involved,î he said.On being asked about the importance of this IPL season in context to next yearís World T20 in India, Boult believes this event will certainly help to get accustomed to the conditions.Yes for sure. The more exposure you have in Indian conditions the better you can understand and the better you can perform. So I think it will certainly help in that case,î he said.With the limited-overs game tilting in favour of the batsmen, Boult opines that a bowler will continue to call the shots.ìYou can look at it that way. The crowd comes to see the ball getting hit and see the good shots. In my opinion this fact offers more opportunities to take wickets. Hopefully we see wickets tumble,î he signed off'

The tallest of the lot however, Sim Bhullar was on his feet for different reasons.Kings were leading the Minnesota Timberwolves by seven points with just 16 seconds left. The game was already won, with the visitors needing seven points. The moment was deemed right by coach George Karl to throw in the 22-year-old for his ëdebutí in a competitive NBA game. Subsequently, the 7í5? Canadian became the first player of Indian origin to compete in the marquee tournament.The dream debut barely lasted long enough for a single play 16 seconds to the hooter. There wasnt much time for the youngster to attempt any of the coveted colossal blocks his 82? wingspan allows. In fact, the only contact Bhullar got to make with the ball was when he took a throw-in after the Timberwolves pulled two points back, with just six seconds left. At the sound of the buzzer, nonetheless, the Kingsí cheer was coupled by congratulations offered to the debutant. The victorsí top scorers on the night, Rudy Gay and Omri Casspi were among the first that approached Bhullar.ìI told him to enjoy the ride,î his teammate, Omri Casspi, who scored a career high 31 points, said. ìYou got 2 billion Indians looking up to you. Be the best role model you can be and have fun with it.î Casspi was the first Israeli-born player in the NBA, so he certainly had a unique perspective on the moment.Sixteen seconds of play after watching two whole games from the bench is what his overall game time record stands at so far. The 10-day contract that Bhullar has been playing under gives him the opportunity to feature in two more games. The next being the return tie against the Utah Jazz early on Thursday morning.Now that he has had a chance to actually step on court, albeit for a quarter of a minute the towering centre will be searching for a better opportunity to play. For the moment though, Bhullar basked in his achievement. ìIt was a great feeling and Iím happy to be kind of an ambassador. This is just the beginning.

        (u'Carolina Marin won her second straight Super Series Premier title, in a repeat of last seasons World Championships final, beating Chinese Xuerui Li in yet another epic summit clash that lasted an hour and 11 minutes. The reigning World Champion relied on a late 8-point surge in Set 3 after trailing 9-14 to stomp past the Olympic champion winning at Kuala Lumpur.Both Marin and Xuerui, as well as Indian ace Saina Nehwal are skipping the next event on the circuit the Singapore Open, and will stay in a close clutch at the top of the rankings, with the first three spots likely to see a rejig on rankings Thursday.The final at the Putra stadium however saw the Spaniard slowly inching towards getting a career-parity (sheís 2-3 head-to-head now) with the top Chinese player, having beaten her a second time post her sensational triumph at the Worlds last year.Relate    After the Summit, the descent for Saina Nehwal   Sun eclipsed, star ahead for Saina Nehwal    Saina Nehwal smashes new mark: First Indian woman to be World No. 1Cranking up her energy after a typically slow start against Xuerui, Marin seemed to appraise her opponentís game in the opening set when she fell back 10-16. But like she had during her All England triumph against Saina Nehwal, Marin was striking some body blows with some late points as her overhead smashing came into play and sowing doubts in Xueruiís head, even if she lost the attack upfront 21-19.Marin, ranked 2 in the world, had hit her stride by the time sheíd changed over to the other side of the court and led 11-5 at the break, continuing to hit with her left-handed lethality, levelling the sets at 21-19. It was an aggressive riposte as she would move quickly to the net for the killers, though it was in tiring out Xuerui that she maxed her momentum going into the decider.The drama was reserved for the third set, as she overturned the apparent advantage that Xuerui enjoyed at 14-9, claiming the next 8 points to grab the lead, forcing the Chinese to scurry to corners and making the most of her gift of changing pace at a snap of a finger towards the culmination of a match. Xuerui whose earliest memory of Marin was a Korea Open match in 2012 that went neck-to-neck from Point 1 to Pont 21 in the decider (the Chinese won that first-ever faceoff) has never been particularly confident in closing out against the Spaniard. Like at the Worlds, she would never recover from the bruising shift that Marin manages in a flurry of winners, and went down to the 21-year-old.

While Bindra, who now claims to be a ëhobbyí shooter, had shot decent scores towards the end of last year, Narang has struggled to strike form of late.In fact, he failed to make the cut for the 10m air rifle squad for the first three rifle/pistol World Cups after he could not record the minimum qualification score set by the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) for the event. He, however, will be part of the team on Friday after he entered in personal capacity to give himself an extra chance of qualifying for the Games.Apart from the Olympic-medal winning duo, Sanjeev Rajput, Satyendra Singh and Chain Singh are the other contenders for India in the 10m air rifle. After Changwon, the rifle and pistol shooters will have three more World Cups and the Asian Championships to win quota places. Earlier, the Indian marksmen found the going tough in the two shotgun World Cups, failing to win a single Rio berth. Jitu Rai is the only shooter who has won a quota place for India so far, in the 50m pistol event. Rai will also be in action on Friday in his pet event alongside Prakash Nanjappa and Om Prakash. Heena Sindhu will lead the womenís field in the womenís 25m event on Friday. Sidhu, who has not been in top form, will take the field in the minimum qualification score category along with Gauri Sheoran. The duo will not be entitled for ranking, medal or quota places.

Ric Charlesworth, after being miracle coach, is now a full-time doting dad.Born to a dentist couple not far from his present abode, the 63-year-old has a dental appointment in an hours time. Sitting on the front porch for 60 minutes with Charlesworth, among kit bags with small size pads and colourful cycles, means time flies. Its about hearing extempore observations that can make any sporting vision document sparkle and some casual observations about the World Cup.The other day, Charlesworth watched the Australia-New Zealand game with his kids, and like most sports-mad families, the father and sons discussed what could or should be done in those tense final moments of the game. Early indicators, according to the man who worked as the high-performance manager of New Zealand cricket and was just a nod away from being national cricket coach after John Buchanan quit, shows that Australia could be the team this time. New Zealand, he thinks, are a few batsmen short. India will be serious contenders, if they donít do something silly. ìLike?,îìIn the first Test of the series last year at Adelaide, they didnt play Ashwin. Explain that to me. An off-spinner won the game for Australia, Ashwin is a good bowler I think. Why this stuff happens. These things are puzzling.î he says. Actually, cricket in general baffles him. ìCricket is pretty primitive,î he says in a dismissive tone. Anything but a conformist, Charlesworth doesnít understand cricketís love for status quo. ìTake a batting order for instance, why is it such a sacrosanct thing. Batting is batting, you go in first or fifth. When we started inter-change in hockey people had to struggle, now when they on-and-off they donít even think about it, itís because they have learnt new skills.îHe brings in baseball to expose cricketís inadequacies. ìThatís what they do in baseball, theyíve had pinch hitters for 100 years.î Charlesworth is amused about cricketís reluctance to place itself under microscope. ìThey donít keep statistics on fielding. They have been doing that for baseball for 100 years. How many times a guy has fumbled, how well does he throw, who hits the wicket most times. They donít even differentiate between an outfield and a slip catch or a running, stationary, diving catch. All these are different, they bunch them together.When with Cricket New Zealand, he pushed for a Fielder of the Year award. ìJohn Buchanan was criticized in this country because he was too much into statistics but before that coaching was done by anecdotes. You actually wanted to know how well does this batsman play the short ball'

        (u'I am overjoyed by the resurgence of Robin Uthappa; not as much for the talent he possesses but for what he has overcome, for the decisions he took in life and the effort he was willing to commit to his decision. Most times most people know what to do; if they dont, an informed opinion isnt too far away. But it is the commitment to doing what it takes that is worthy of admiration. With Uthappa the runs were merely a by-product, a consequence of training and working hard when the result was far away and unknown. That is what produces applause and brings a smile.I like the new-look Uthappa because his batting is tighter, more stylish than it was (and he was always stylish) and in an almost contrarian way, he has found freedom through going back to technique. By becoming tighter, by playing closer to his body I suspect he is playing shots that give him greater value and greater longevity. With Uthappa, it was never a question of class or timing, it was about being in long enough to cause lasting damage. He has chiseled his game and is looking so much better for itBut now, the challenges begin. Can he continue to play within the new boundaries he has set for himself. Or will he rebel against his own discipline and seek newer territories for his boundless talent? Just as investors follow certain scrips, cricket watchers must follow Uthappa to see where he goes. I wish him well, he is a fine young man who has endured, and frittered away, much. He has now found peace and stability; those are boundaries for some, pathways for others.If Uthappaís was the dramatic resurgence at the IPL, it was a new look Wriddhiman Saha who caught everyoneís eye. You knew Saha was smooth and classy behind the stumps, that in front of them he was more than just capable, also that he was a brilliant fielder when the gloves were worn by someone else. But could he hit the ball with such intensity? Very few, dare I say nobody, could say they saw this coming. We never know, do we, who really resides within a person!. This is excellent news for Indian cricket. And it can be even better if Saha catalyses an Uthappa like resurgence in Dinesh Karthik. I suspect that a year from now, MS Dhoni would be looking at his career through a more critical lens and India will benefit from having a healthy competition between Saha and Karthik for the latter is a possessor of rare gifts too.','sports'),

        (u'Twenty minutes into extra time in the Champions League Finals in Lisbon, Gareth Bale leaped into history. It was a simple header at the far post with no one to challenge him. A player with a world record price tag of 100 million euros is expected to slot such opportunities home blindfold. But in Bales context, the goal turned out to be the crowning moment of his first season at Real Madrid.He had earlier bungled two big chances to become a hero in regulation time in the Champions League final. On the half-hour mark, a surging run forward had taken him to striking distance. But the finish was poor. Then on 77 minutes, he once again hit wide from close range.The 24-year-old Welshman looked nervy despite coming into this game on the heels of a very good La Liga season. But at Real Madrid, a player is judged by his Champions League exploits, and the occasion appeared to be getting big on Bale.Bale was roped in to provide the cutting edge. His first challenge, however, was to get out of Ronaldos shadow and make his own mark. He did that with 15 goals and 12 assists in 24 matches in La Liga and another six goals and four assists in the Champions League. Creditable for someone who just completed his first season in Spanish football. But to become a part of Real Madrid folklore, Bale had to score in the final. Sergio Ramos has to be thanked for his equaliser in added time, that allowed Bale a second opportunity. But for Ramos strike Bale would have been torn apart for missing those two chances. The club bosses would have been flayed for forking out ìsilly moneyî. But given an extra half an hour, Bale made amends for his earlier errors.'

Its like school teens rolling down their socks to glam up, the whole thing smacking of silly giggling.But one cant blame badminton for jumping to the most convenient conclusions as it attempts (for no apparent reason) to appease the nameless stadium spectator and engage the faceless TV viewers: that to hold on to its fans, it needs to go short, get crisper and stay briefest.Arguably, cricket and baseball needed the trim. Hockeys clocked at 60 minutes now and wrestling too contemplated a compress. Now, all the leagues mushrooming in India are leaping to take liberties to wrap it up quick the sport itself before drizzling the game-night with the song-and-dance dressing. From the convoluted 15◊3 classic scoring system that boggled viewers to the brief and futile 5◊7 attempt, badminton has ceded enough ground to broadcasters compulsions before settling nicely into the 21◊3 rally point system 10 years ago. Yet another change will be a swig one too many. Mercifully, the likes of Lin Dan and P Gopichand have summarily shot down the need to fiddle needlessly with the scoring in badminton. Sporting events that really endure  the five-set singles Grand Slams, the five-day cricket Tests and all of the serious 90-minute football ó have eschewed these hemline-raising gimmicks. Strong legacies are built on unchanging consistency. It makes you wonder  in the extreme if those helming sports the brains are bored of their own sport. Why is the first instinct for all rule-makers (under pressure to make their sport interesting) to shorten the duration of their game? Last heard, watching sport was leisure. How did a 60-minute badminton match suddenly become over-bearing? Rule-makers might be inspired by the ancient tale of Ouroboros  snake eating its own tail for cyclical recreating. To sum up the fussing, this over-enthusiastic tweaking of scoring systems is more like shooting oneself in the foot to us.

You have always be humble and assume that there is something to learn. You have to keep setting yourself with new goals. I became World Champion for the first time in 2000, and it was in my third attempt," Anand said."The failures managed to motivate me to keep trying and I got better each time. The second time I did better than the first and the third time, I had enough of being second. When you sniff the world title, I knew in my blood, in my being, that it is not over till you finish the job."I knew that I had to wait and there could be no euphoria, no relaxation, till I finish the job, so this time I managed to see everything through the end and I became a world champion," he recently stated at the IMC Ramakrishna Bajaj National Quality Awards.Recollecting the phase when he became India first Grandmaster, Anand said he lost the focus soon after winning the title."When I was young, there were steady goals at every stage. First was to become an International Master, then become a Grandmaster, and then try for the World Championship," he said."When I won the Grandmaster title, which was right after winning the World Junior title in 1987, I had a funny period of about six months where I simply couldnt make a Grandmaster result again. Though I had become a Grandmaster, I had received the title, but I simply attain a Grandmaster result again."What happened is something I later on discovered, which many Grandmasters shared. They all said yes, we all went through this period of six months after getting our title he added.Anand said he became a bit complacent after winning the World Championship for the first time, which affected him and it took him a while to play at the same level again.For the first few months my results held up, I won two tournaments things were going well. This time I slowly let myself become a bit complacent. Perhaps things were not bad this time and maybe, since I was aware of the problem, at some level I was dealing with Then in July, I had the worst result of my life in Dortmund and after that it took me eight months before I could start playing at a level I was comfortable with again.

You need a big player, a top 10 player, who is going to make the game popular and by seeing him, more kids take up the game," Ivanisevic, who is in India for the Road to Wimbledon programme said.Ivanisevic, best known for his straight talk and a booming serve, feels the Indian players are not pushing hard enough despite having the skill. However, he is surprised to find that girls are more talented than boys."From what I have seen, I have to say that I like the girls more than guys. I dont mean guys are bad but the girls are more talented. Probably, this is a wakeup call for the guys to push more, work harder," said the fit looking 43-year-old with a smile."Cricket is number one here because everyone plays cricket. So you need somebody like a Leander Paes or Mahesh (Bhupathi). They were big stars but now you need someone else to promote the game.

Ask him where the Indian players lack in comparison to the Europeans, Ivanisevic puts the difference down to just hard work.I think the kids need to push harder. The coaches have to be harder on them. You cannot coach kids who are 12 or 13 years old and let them be the boss. You have to make them work. The talent and skill is there but physically kids in Europe are much better. Besides there is so much to learn. How to play the points, your mental strength. It is not just about hitting the ball over the net. In addition to that, there is a need to educate the coaches. I hope they were listening to me when I was talking yesterday," said the 2001 Wimbledon winner.Ivanisevic was  for his racquet breaking behaviour on court besides his other eccentricities, but he has been forced to mellow down ever since he took to coaching. one can gauge in his voice the pride he feels about guiding Marin Cilic to the 2014 US Open title. Not the maverick he was in his hey days, Ivanisevic the coach has a message for the younger crop."I was a player who took risks. You have to take risk. You have to push your luck to see what is going to happen. I like to see people like that. In Marin case, he had to take risks to win a Grand Slam. He had to go for his shots, I like guys like that," he said.The game has a lot more money than the time when Ivanisevic played. So much so that he is amazed to see the attitude of some upcoming players. "These days you have players who are 13 and 14 and they know about the prize money of all tournaments beforehand. They are talking sponsors, endorsements and what not. Money is important but at a young age you just have to think about enjoying the game. The game is beautiful," he said.  What  easier? Coaching from the sidelines or playing on court? I have to say it is much easier to play  I am still learning as a coach. It took me couple of months to learn certain things, it matter if I was a good player. As a coach, you got to know what to say, when to say. I learnt from other coaches on tour. It is complicated. You need to be patient. You have to believe in your player and he has to believe in you," said Ivanisevic.'

Then I started to enjoy hockey a lot more than cricket as it is fast and entertaining."I would have liked to be involved in sports. I like all sports whether its cricket, golf everything. My hand eye co-ordination is pretty good, so I would have tried to get into cricket or golf," he said.Dwyer on Sunday surpassed Jay Stacy to become Australia most-capped hockey player and also scored his 207th goal in the Kookburras 7-0 win over s a great honour to be the most-capped player for Australia. It is something I guess I will look back after my career is finish, be proud of what I have achieved," he said."I held Jay very highly. So it feels a bit weird passing Jay record because Jay was one of the main reasons I wanted to play for the Kookaburras. He was a role model to me. There were posters of Jay in my wall while I was growing up. He is a true legend," said Dwyer, who became a father of a baby girl last week."Last week I became father of a beautiful girl named Zara. I have got two elder boys and I was expecting another boy but it was a nice surprise. Now my family is complete, Dwyer signed '

        (u'World champion Lewis Hamilton on Thursday promised that Mercedes would strike back at this weekend Chinese Grand Prix after being ambushed by Ferrari Sebastian Vettel in Malaysia.Vettel stunning victory in the heat of Sepang has raised hopes of a genuine battle for the Formula One championship after Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg won 16 of 19 races last year and romped to a one-two finish in this season opener in Melbourne.But Hamilton, who raged at his team over the radio as Vettel ended Ferrari 34-race drought, predicted normal service would be resumed in Shanghai this Sunday after being relegated to second place by the German."As far as I aware of, I don think we have any concerns," the Briton told reporters. "We re just focusing on doing a better job. It was an untidy weekend collectively as a group. We could have done a better job, including myself and maybe Nico, I don  are just trying to understand how we can do better and trying to implement it here," added Hamilton, who won in China for the third time last year. Despite Vettel having exploded the aura of invincibility Mercedes had built after storming to victory in the previous eight races straddling this season and last, Hamilton insisted Malaysia was merely a blip."I think everyone perhaps was surprised (by Ferrari) but we have had so many amazing races for such a long, long time," sniffed Hamilton. "So one little hiccup at the weekend, and to still get two podiums is pretty awesome."Kimi Raikkonenm fourth place after fighting back from an early puncture provided further encouragement for Ferrari, who had not been expected to show as much pace so soon this year.Hamilton fumed at the Mercedes crew over the radio for giving him the wrong tyres in Malaysia and, despite being all smiles in Shanghai, he still clearly felt that strategy, particularly the decision to pit three times to Vettel had cost victory."Going back we would have done things a little differently," he said. "Maybe if we had changed the set-up a little bit, made the tyres last a little bit longer. That was something we missed so naturally when we got behind, the tyres were already melting. There was no margin (for error). Maybe if we stayed out with those changes, maybe w at least been in the fight. It would have been much closer than the 10-second gap between us."Rosberg cheeky invitation for Vettel to attend the Mercedes debrief in Malaysia served only to fire up his fellow German, but Hamilton also called for Ferrari to make a sustained challenge."I hope we can get back to winning," he smiled. "The track seems to suit my style of driving. But I also hope it a close fight between us and Ferrari. That would be cool.'
